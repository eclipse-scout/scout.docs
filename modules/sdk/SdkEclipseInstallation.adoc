== Scout SDK Installation

This chapter walks you through the installation of the Eclipse Scout SDK.
There are two ways to install it.

1. Install a prepackaged Eclipse IDE tailored for Scout developers.
2. Install the Scout SDK plugins into an existing Eclipse IDE.

=== Install Eclipse IDE for Scout Developers

The installation process for the Eclipse package containing Scout is described in the http://eclipsescout.github.io/{scout-short-version}/helloscout.html#Eclipse[Hello Scout Tutorial].

=== Add Scout to your Existing Eclipse IDE

This section describes the installation of Scout into an existing Eclipse installation.
As the audience of this section is assumed to be familiar with Eclipse, we do not describe how you got your Eclipse installation in the first place.
For the provided screenshots we start from the popular package _Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers_.

To add Scout to your existing Eclipse installation, you need to start Eclipse.
Then select the menu:Help[Install New Software...] menu as shown in <<img-eclipse_install_new_software>> to open the install dialog.

In the install dialog, select the update site matching your Eclipse installation.
Type Scout into the filter field below and select Eclipse Scout SDK (Binary only).
Then, move through the installation with the btn:[Next] button.
On the last installation step, accept the presented EPL terms by clicking on the appropriate radio button.
To complete the installation, click the btn:[Finish] button and accept the request for a restart of Eclipse.
After the restart of the Eclipse IDE the Scout SDK is ready to use!

=== Verifying the Installation

The simplest way to verify your Scout installation is to create a "`Hello World`" Scout project
and run the corresponding Scout application as described in http://eclipsescout.github.io/{scout-short-version}/helloscout.html[Hello Scout].
