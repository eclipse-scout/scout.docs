The screenshot below shows the opened NLS editor.
In the first column the `key` values are shown that are used in accessing translations through `TEXTS.get("key")`.
The second columns holds the default translations followed by columns holding the translations for other translated languages.

Import and Export requires additional components.

Hide inherited rows checkbox

On the top of each column, the text fields allow you to filter the entries in the table.
With the btn:[Reset] button on the right you will empty those filters.

The entries in the table can be directly edited by pressing F2 or double-clicking into a text cell.

On each row it is possible to call following context menu:

==== Default Mapping to Properties Files

The mapping between the properties files is registered in the "Text Provider Service" class.
Per default the files follow this pattern:
`<your application>.shared/src/main/resources/<identifier of the project>/texts/Texts<language>.properties`

where:

* `<identifier of the project>` is a chain of folders following the same convention as the Java source files with the package name.
For example the `org.eclipse.contacts.shared` project uses `org/eclipse/scout/contacts/shared` as path.
* `<language>` is an identifier of the language and the country. Some possible file names:
** `Texts.properties` is the default language
** `Texts_de.properties` is for German
** `Texts_fr_BE` will be for French in Belgium

==== Find missing NLS Keys

If NLS keys are used in the code that do not exist in a properties file, an ugly placeholder is displayed to the user. To find such missing translations the Menu `Scout -> Search missing text keys...` may be handy.
The result is listed in the Eclipse `Search` view.

The search also takes the scope of each NLS key into account. So that the key is considered to be available there must be a `TextProviderService` with that key on the classpath of that module.

Reported false positives can be suppressed using the following comment at the end of the corresponding line: `NO-NLS-CHECK`. Matches on that line are then not reported in future searches anymore.
