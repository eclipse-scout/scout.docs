[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.scout.rt</groupId>
    <artifactId>org.eclipse.scout.rt</artifactId>
    <version>{maven-version}</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
----

=== Scout Runtime for JavaScript

Scout Runtime artifacts for JavaScript are distributed using npm:

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-scout/core[Scout Core Runtime]
* https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40eclipse-scout[All official Scout JavaScript packages]

Usage example in your package.json:

[source,json]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{
  "name": "my-module",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@eclipse-scout/cli": "{node-version}",
    "@eclipse-scout/releng": "^22.0.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@eclipse-scout/core": "{node-version}",

{scout-sdk-download-link}

To install the Scout SDK into your existing Eclipse IDE, use this P2 update site: +
{scout-sdk-update-site}

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== New 3rd Party requirements

Scout 23.1 requires at least Node 18.12.1. Older versions will not work.
A new version can be obtained from https://nodejs.org/en/download/[the Node download page].

Scout now requires at least pnpm 7.16.0. You can install it as described on the https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm[pnpm installation page].

To update your application the following steps might be required:

* Update the version of the `maven_rt_plugin_config-master` in your `pom.xml` files to the newest `23.1.x` release. See https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.eclipse.scout/maven_rt_plugin_config-master[Maven central] for a list of versions available.
* Update the Scout versions (`package.json` and `pom.xml`) as shown in <<Obtaining the Latest Version>>.
* If you are using Eclipse and web-service providers, update the `.factorypath` files as shown in the `JAX-WS Appendix` of the Scout documentation.
* The support for the Maven build plugin `org.kuali.maven.plugins:properties-maven-plugin` has been replaced with `org.codehaus.mojo:properties-maven-plugin`. Update the groupId accordingly. Please consult the plugin documentation for the http://site.kuali.org/maven/plugins/properties-maven-plugin/2.0.1/plugin-info.html[old] and the https://www.mojohaus.org/properties-maven-plugin/plugin-info.html[new] plugin for instruction on how to migrate the plugin configuration.
* The dependency to `org.jboss:jandex` has been renamed to `io.smallrye:jandex` and the corresponding build plugin from `org.jboss.jandex:jandex-maven-plugin` to `io.smallrye:jandex-maven-plugin`. In case one of these artifacts is used in your code, update the groupId accordingly.

=== Update of other 3rd Party JavaScript libraries

Perform the following migration in all your `package.json` files:

* If you specify the minimum engines versions, please update them as follows:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.12.1",
    "npm": ">=9.1.1",
    "pnpm": ">=7.16.0"
  }
}
----
* Update the following dependencies (if existing in your application):
+
[source]
----
"jasmine-core": "4.5.0"
"karma": "6.4.1"
"eslint": "8.27.0"

----
* Remove the following dependencies:
+
[source]
----
"@babel/core"
"@babel/eslint-parser"
"@babel/eslint-plugin"
----

Replace the content of your .eslintrc.js with the following:

[source,js]
----
module.exports = {
  extends: '@eclipse-scout'
};

----

== RegisterNamespace

In all your `index.js` files, replace the last line as follows:

.From
[source,javascript]
----
window.yourNamespace = Object.assign(window.yourNamespace || {}, self);
----

.To
[source,javascript]
----
ObjectFactory.get().registerNamespace('yourNamespace', self);
----

See the JsDoc of the `registerNamespace` method if you are curious what it does.

== ObjectType as Class Reference (Scout JS)

As described in the {release-notes-link}, it is now possible to use class references for the `objectType`.
Even though the string based style still works and a migration is not necessary, the class reference style is the preferred way for the future.

We highly recommend you migrate your code, so you can benefit of the improved type safety and code completion.

To do so, you can use the Scout migration tool, which migrates the strings and also tries to add the required imports automatically.
Alternatively, you can do it by yourself using your IDE and Find/Replace.

To use the migration tool, follow the steps described here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-scout/migrate#objecttype-and-menutype-migration[@eclipse-scout/migrate]

=== Alternative Way to Migrate ObjectType

If the above script somehow does not work for you, you can do the migration by yourself as follows:

. Find and replace all occurrences of `scout.create()`, `objectType:`, `lookupCall:` and `logicalGrid:` (use Ctrl-Shift-R in IntelliJ and enable Regex).
+
[source]
----
Find: scout.create\('(.*\.)?(.*)'
Replace: scout.create\($2
----
+
[source]
----
Find: objectType: '(.*\.)?(.*)'
Replace: objectType: $2
----
+
[source]
----
Find: lookupCall: '(.*\.)?(.*)'
Replace: lookupCall: $2
----
+
[source]
----
Find: logicalGrid: '(.*\.)?(.*)'
Replace: logicalGrid: $2
----
+
The regex considers objectTypes with and without namespace.

. Add imports  +
Now we need to add the required imports.
You can either manually add them, but with a lot of files it is a tedious task.
Unfortunately, IntelliJ does not provide a possibility to automatically add all missing imports.
But there is a trick: resolve multiple inspections at once using code analysis.

.. Start the action `Run inspection by name` and select the inspection `Unresolved JavaScript variable`.
+
.Start Action
image::{mgimgsdir}/unresolved-variable-inspection.png[]
.Select inspection
image::{mgimgsdir}/unresolved-variable-inspection-1.png[]
.. Select `Uncommitted files` and disable all inspection options, because the inspection is not limited to missing imports.
Click OK to run the analysis.
+
.Run Action
image::{mgimgsdir}/unresolved-variable-inspection-2.png[]

.. In the result view, select one or more problems and click the button `Missing import statement`.
+
Note: Sometimes `Missing import statement` is located in a drop down called `Apply quick fixes to all the problems`.
+
Note: Even though we disabled all inspection options, there may still be problems other than `Missing import statement`.
If that is the case, resolving multiple problems is not possible unless you unselect these problems including theirs parent node.
+
.Resolve problems
image::{mgimgsdir}/unresolved-variable-inspection-3.png[]
.Button in drop down
image::{mgimgsdir}/unresolved-variable-inspection-3a.png[]

.. Finally, you need to verify, whether the imports are correct.
Please make sure all imports are present for every object type and the classes are imported from a module and not a single file.
+
.Good import
[source,js]
----
import {Button, GroupBox} from '@eclipse-scout/core';
----
+
.Bad import
[source,js]
----
import Button from '@eclipse-scout/core/src/form/fields/button/Button.js';
----

== MenuTypes as Constants (Scout JS)

Since there are now constants for menu types, you can replace the string literals and use these constants.

The migration can be done automatically using the migration tool.
If you already used it to migrate the object type (<<ObjectType as Class Reference (Scout JS)>>), the menu types have probably already been migrated.
Otherwise, follow the instructions described here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-scout/migrate#objecttype-and-menutype-migration[@eclipse-scout/migrate]

== Scout JS API Changes

Along with the TypeScript migration, we had to adjust the API a little and removed some obsolete code.
Please check if your JavaScript uses the mentioned methods and adjust it accordingly.

=== Rename WidgetTooltip.widget

The `widget` property of `WidgetTooltip` has been renamed to `content`.
Together with the property itself the corresponding setter has been renamed from `setWidget` to `setContent`.

=== Rename WidgetPopup.widget (Scout JS & Scout Classic)

The `widget` property on `WidgetPopup` classes (and all its subclasses) has been renamed to `content`:

. Scout JS
.. Update the `widget` property in all JS models creating WidgetPopups from `widget` to `content`.
.. Rename the `_renderWidget` method on subclasses of `WidgetPopup` to `_renderContent`.
.. `setWidget` on WidgetPopups has been renamed to `setContent`.
. Scout Classic
.. `IWidgetPopup#PROP_WIDGET` has been renamed to `IWidgetPopup#PROP_CONTENT`.
.. `IWidgetPopup#getWidget` has been renamed to `IWidgetPopup#getContent`.
.. `AbstractWidgetPopup#getConfiguredWidget` as been renamed to `AbstractWidgetPopup#getConfiguredContent`.
.. `AbstractWidgetPopup#createWidget` as been renamed to `AbstractWidgetPopup#createContent`.
.. `AbstractWidgetPopup#setWidget` as been renamed to `AbstractWidgetPopup#setContent`.

=== Rename ProposalChooser.model

The `model` property on `ProposalChooser` class (and all its subclasses) has been renamed to `content`:

. Scout JS
.. Rename the `_createModel` method on subclasses of `ProposalChooser` to `_createContent`.
.. Rename the `_renderModel` method on subclasses of `ProposalChooser` to `_renderContent`.

=== Options-parameter for filter-methods in menus.js

The methods `filter` and `filterAccordingToSelection` in `menus.js` now have an options-parameter. This parameter combines the former parameters `onlyVisible`, `enableDisableKeyStrokes` and `notAllowedTypes`.
The following are two migration examples:

.Old
[source,js]
----
let allowedTypes = ['Example.MenuType'],
  onlyVisible = true,
  enableDisableKeyStrokes = false;

// example 1
menus.filter(this.menus, allowedTypes, true, false);

// example 2
menus.filter(this.menus, allowedTypes, onlyVisible, enableDisableKeyStrokes);

----

.New
[source,js]
----
let allowedTypes = ['Example.MenuType'],
  onlyVisible = true,
  enableDisableKeyStrokes = false;

// example 1
menus.filter(this.menus, allowedTypes, {
  onlyVisible: true,
  enableDisableKeyStrokes: false
});

// example 2
menus.filter(this.menus, allowedTypes, {onlyVisible, enableDisableKeyStrokes});

----

=== JQuery-Scout

The following functions have been removed because they are not in use anymore.

- removeThis
- suppressEventIfDisabled
- colorOpacity
- copyCssIfGreater
- backupSelection
- restoreSelection
- onSingleOrDoubleClick

The following functions have been renamed

. widthToContent -> cssWidthToContentAnimated

=== Table

TableFilter.js has been removed because it has no benefits.

With TypeScript, the interface `Filter<TableRow>` should be used instead.
With JavaScript, `extends from TableFilter` can be removed.

=== Testing / karma-jasmine-scout

The following functions have been removed because they are not in use anymore.

- createAdapterModel
- stripCommentsFromJson
- definedProperty
- sameProperty
- JQuery.triggerMouseMove
- JQuery.triggerWithPosition

The following functions have been renamed.

- widgetCloneProperty -> toHaveClonedWidgetProperty

The jquery-plugin jqueryExtensions has been refactored to a ES6 module to avoid pollution (of code completion) of the JQuery object outside test environment.
In the rare case you used these functions for testing, you need to import them now, the JQuery-object does not contain them anymore.

=== Various Clean Up

The following model properties have been removed because they are not in use.

- WidgetModel.loadJsonModel
- TooltipSupportOptions.$parent

== JS Build Improvements

=== Imports

Scout JS files cannot be imported directly anymore and need to be imported from the scout module.
You are probably using the correct import style already, since file based import was bad practise anyway.
In case there are file based imports, just adjust them as follows:

.Old
[source,js]
----
import Table from '@eclipse-scout/core/src/table/Table'
----

.New
[source,js]
----
import {Table} from '@eclipse-scout/core'
----

The following modules are affected:

- @eclipse-scout/core/src -> @eclipse-scout/core
- @eclipse-scout/core/src/testing -> @eclipse-scout/core/testing

IMPORTANT: This applies only to imports of `js` files. Imports to `less` files should stay untouched (for now).

== IId types, IdFactory and IdExternalFormatter

Up to release 2022 the support for typed identifiers (IId) was limited to root ids wrapping one specific Java identifier.
The support was extended to include composite ids wrapping multiple java identifiers.
As part of this new feature a refactoring of the existing id classes was done which may require some migration steps:

* `IId` was typed with a generic parameter `<WRAPPED_TYPE>` which was removed and moved to `AbstractRootId`. If you need this generic parameter, change your code to use `AbstractRootId` instead of `IId` or consider removing the generic parameter at interface-level in your code as well.
* `IId` up to release 2022 were limited to wrap a single value. If your code rely on a single wrapped value, replace `IId` by `IRootId` and `AbstractId` by `AbstractRootId`. If you don't change your code type and use `IId` you implicitly add support for composite types in your APIs.
* Some factory methods for building ids and serialization where moved between classes and/or renamed (the serialized string representation is identical):
** `IdExternalFormatter.getTypeName()` -> `IdInventory.getTypeName()`
** `IdExternalFormatter.getIdClass()` -> `IdInventory.getIdClass()`
** `IdExternalFormatter.toExternalForm()` -> `IdCodec.toQualified()`
** `IdExternalFormatter.fromExternalForm()` -> `IdCodec.fromQualified()`
** `IdExternalFormatter.fromExternalFormLenient()` -> `IdCodec.fromQualifiedLenient()`
** `IId.unwrapAsString()` -> `IdCodec.toUnqualified()` (Note: Unwrap as string is still available for `IRootId` but according to the javadoc should only be used for logging and debugging purpose)
** `IdFactory.createFromString()` -> `IdCodec.fromUnqualified()`
* Completeness test for ids was improved. Use `AbstractIdStructureTest` as base for id completeness tests in own maven modules.
** Implementations of `AbstractStringId` are required to create a null-id instance if invoked with an empty string (e.g. use `if (StringUtility.isNullOrEmpty(id)) { return null; }` in your static `of()` method, see `FixtureStringId` as example)
** The former base classes `AbstractUuIdStructureTest` and `AbstractStringIdStructureTest` were integrated and removed

== Renaming of DoStructureMigration to DataObjectMigration

Because the `DoStructureMigrator` executes value migrations too (`IDoValueMigrationHandler`), several renamings were applied.

Classes:

* DoStructureMigrationContext -> DataObjectMigrationContext
* DoStructureMigrationCountingPassThroughLogger -> DataObjectMigrationCountingPassThroughLogger
* DoStructureMigrationInventory -> DataObjectMigrationInventory
* DoStructureMigrationPassThroughLogger -> DataObjectMigrationPassThroughLogger
* DoStructureMigrationStatsContextData -> DataObjectMigrationStatsContextData
* DoStructureMigrator -> DataObjectMigrator
* IDoStructureMigrationGlobalContextData -> IDataObjectMigrationGlobalContextData
* IDoStructureMigrationLocalContextData -> IDataObjectMigrationLocalContextData
* IDoStructureMigrationLogger -> IDataObjectMigrationLogger

Test classes:

* TestDoStructureMigrationInventory -> TestDataObjectMigrationInventory
* TestDoStructureMigrator -> TestDataObjectMigrator

Methods:

* DataObjectMigrationInventory#getMigrationHandlers -> #getStructureMigrationHandlers
* DataObjectMigrationInventory#getDoMigrationContextValues -> #getDoStructureMigrationTargetContextDatas

Removals (see deprecation warning in 22.0 for further information):

* DoStructureMigrator#migrateDataObject(DataObjectMigrationContext, IDataObject)
* DoStructureMigrator#migrateDataObject(DataObjectMigrationContext, IDataObject, IDataObjectMigrationLocalContextData...)
* DoStructureMigrator#migrateDataObject(DataObjectMigrationContext, IDataObject, NamespaceVersion, IDataObjectMigrationLocalContextData...)
* TestDoStructureMigrationInventory#TestDoStructureMigrationInventory(List<INamespace>, Collection<ITypeVersion>, Collection<Class<? extends IDoStructureMigrationTargetContextData>>, IDoStructureMigrationHandler...)
