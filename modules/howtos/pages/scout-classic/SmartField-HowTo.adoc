= SmartField: How to Apply Colors and Styles From a Lookup Row
include::common:partial$_header.adoc[]

When a user selects a lookup-row from the proposal chooser in Scout versions <= 6.0, the properties `foregroundColor`, `backgroundColor`, `font` and `tooltipText` have been automatically copied from the lookup-row to the field. In some cases this was exactly what a specific application needed, but in other cases it was hard to implement a specific behavior without overriding internal methods from the `SmartField`. For instance it was not possible to have a lookup-row with background-color red in the proposal-chooser and at the same time avoid the background-color of the field changing to red, when that row was being selected.

Since that automatic behavior didn't fit every business requirement, we removed it completely. This means a programmer must now implement specific code to read properties from the lookup-row and set them on the field. The following example is from the Scout widgets app. It changes the background-color of the field.

[source,java]
.Java example, set the background-color of the lookup-row on the field
----
@Override
protected void execChangedValue() {
  updateFieldBackgroundColor();
}

/**
 * Sets the color of the field to the color of the selected lookup row.
 */
protected void updateFieldBackgroundColor() {
  ILookupRow<?> lookupRow = getLookupRow();
  String bgColor = lookupRow == null ? null : lookupRow.getBackgroundColor();
  setBackgroundColor(bgColor);
}

Since Scout 8.0 the property `cssClass` from the lookup-row is automatically applied to the .form-field DIV. This gives the programmer the flexibility to style either both, lookup-row and field, or only the lookup-row in the proposal-chooser via CSS/LESS.

Here's a LESS example from the Scout widget app that sets the background-color of lookup-row and field. It is used for the `EventTypeCodeType` which defines 3 codes with the CSS classes public, private and external:

[source,less]
.LESS example, style lookup-row and field with the same CSS class
----
.form-field.public > .field, .table-row.public {
  background-color: @palette-green-0;
}

.form-field.private > .field, .table-row.private {
  background-color: @palette-orange-1;
}

.form-field.external > .field, .table-row.external {
  background-color: @palette-gray-3;
}
----

_Conclusion_: older Scout apps that rely on the automatic behavior for the properties mentioned above, should use CSS classes instead of the properties back-/foregroundColor or font. If that's not possible you should implement logic as shown in the example above where required, possibly moving that code in a class that extends `AbstractSmartField`, if the same code is required in multiple places.
