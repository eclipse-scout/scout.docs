The _Add a Language_ wizard can be used to create additional translation files in order to localize the user interface.
It can be started from the <<sdk_editor_nls.adoc#nls-editor, The NLS Editor>>.

It is possible to crate one translation file that corresponds to the user locale, which are specified by a language and optionally a country (`de`, `de_DE`, `de_CH` and so on).
