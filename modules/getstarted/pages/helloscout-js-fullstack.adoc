= Hello Scout JS Full Stack
include::common:partial$_header.adoc[]

== Introduction

In this tutorial we will create a Scout JS application consisting of a JavaScript frontend connected using REST to a Java backend that stores the data in a database.

NOTE: If you don't know what Scout JS is yet, please read the xref:getstarted:getstarted.adoc[Get Started Guide] first.

We will create the application using IntelliJ.
The generated application can display persons loaded from a database.
These persons can be edited or deleted and new persons can be added.
