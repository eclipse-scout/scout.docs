== Introduction

In this tutorial we will create your first Scout Classic application.

NOTE: If you don't know what Scout Classic is yet, please read the xref:getstarted:getstarted.adoc[Get Started Guide] first.

We will create the application using Eclipse or IntelliJ.
The generated application will consist of a client and server part and simply display a text sent from the server.
