== The "`Contacts`" Application

The "`Contacts`" demo application is a client server application to manage personal contacts, organizations and events.
The persistence of entered data is achieved via simple JDBC access to a Derby database.

It is recommended that you first import the full "`Contacts`" demo application into a separate workspace.
This gives you the possibility to check your source code against the full implementation during the various steps of the tutorial.
To do so, just clone the Scout demo repository and import it into your IDE.

 git clone https://github.com/bsi-software/org.eclipse.scout.docs.git

Alternatively, you can also view the source code of the "`Contacts`" demo application on https://github.com/bsi-software/org.eclipse.scout.docs/tree/{git-branch}/code/contacts[Github].

The "`Contacts`" application shows the basic user interface layout of a typical Scout application.
The main areas of this layout are briefly introduced below.

Outline Button:: In <<img-app_contacts_personpage>> the top left area shows a folder icon that represents the "Contacts" outline.
The small down arrow at the folder icon indicates that additional outlines are available when clicking on this view button.
On the right of the button with the folder icon is a second outline button that activates a search outline (not implemented yet).
Navigation Tree:: The navigation tree on the left side of the layout shows the pages that are available for the selected outline.
For the "Contacts" outline, the navigation tree provides access to the pages "Persons", "Organizations" and "Events".
Selecting a page then shows associated information on the right side in the bench area.
In the case of the selected "Persons" page the bench area shows a list of persons in the form of a table.
Header:: The header area is located at the top and holds the available top level menus.
In this example these are the "Quick access", "Options" menu points as well as a user menu that shows the username of the currently logged in user "mzi".
Bench:: The bench represents the main display area of a Scout application.
When selecting the "Persons" page, a table provides access to all available persons as shown in <<img-app_contacts_personpage>>.
Selecting a specific person provides access to all actions that are available for the selected person.
The selected person can then be opened with the [menu]_Edit_ menu which opens the person in a view that is displayed in the bench area again as shown in <<img-app_contacts_personform>>.

For entering and editing of data in Scout applications views are used in most cases.
Views are displayed in the bench area of a Scout application.
Several views can also be opened simultaneously.
To show a specific view the user has to click on the view button associated with the desired view.
An example of an opened view is shown for person "Ver√≥nica" in <<img-app_contacts_personform>>.

== Tutorial Overview

This tutorial walks you through the implementation of a Scout application consisting of a frontend and a backend application.
The frontend application contains outlines with navigation trees, pages to present information in tabular form, and forms to view and edit data.
In the backend application the tutorial shows how to implement services, logging, database access, and several other aspects of Scout applications.

The tutorial is organized as a sequence of consecutive steps as listed below.
Each step is described in a individual section that results in a executable application that can be tested and compared against the full "Contacts" demo application.

Step 1: Setting up the Initial Project (<<sec-contacts_initial_project>>)::
We will create a new project and prepare the generated code base by adapting existing components and deleting unnecessary components.
At the end of step one we have a project setup that allows us to start adding new components to the application.

Step 2: Adding the Person and Organization Page (<<sec-contacts_pages>>)::
The second step adds the user interface components to display persons and organizations.
For this a "Persons" page and an "Organizations" page are created and added to the "Contacts" outline as shown in <<img-app_contacts_personpage>>.

Step 3: Creating and Accessing the Database (<<sec-contacts_jdbc>>)::
This step concentrates on the backend of the "Contacts" application.
The covered topics include dealing with application properties, setup and access of a database and using the database to provide data for the person and organization page created in the previous step.

Step 4: Adding a Form to Create/Edit Persons (<<sec-contacts_forms>>)::
After having access to the database the components that allow a user to create and edit persons and organizations in the user interface of the "Contacts" application can be added.
In addition, this tutorial step also demonstrates how to design and implement complex form layouts with the Scout framework.

Step 5: Form Field Validation and Template Fields (<<sec-contacts_fields>>)::
This step provides an introduction into form field validation and the creation of template fields.
Validation of user input is important for many business applications and template fields help to improve code quality with a mechanism to reuse application specific user interface components.

Step 6: Adding the Company Form (<<sec-contacts_form_add_company>>)::
We create the organization form to create and enter organizations in the "Contacts" application.
As we can reuse many of the components developed so far this is the shortest tutorial step.

Step 7: Linking Organizations and Persons (<<sec-contacts_link_organization_person>>)::
In this step we modify the user interface to implement a 1:n relationship between organizations and persons.
This includes the creation of a hierarchical page structure for organization, adding an organization column to the person page and adding an organization field to the person form to manage the association of a person to an organization.
