If you have no IntelliJ yet, you can download it from the https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download[JetBrains download site].
We recommend selecting the Ultimate edition to have the JavaScript support included in the IDE.
There is a 30-day trial if you have no licence.
For this tutorial you can also use the free Community Edition, but it requires some extra steps indicated.

Install or extract the package and start IntelliJ (see https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-for-the-first-time.html[Run IntelliJ IDEA for the first time] for instructions).
Follow the instructions until the `Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA` screen is shown.

On the left side switch to `Plugins`, search for `Eclipse Scout` and press the green `Install` button.
In case a `Third-Party Plugins Privacy Notice` is shown, press `Accept`. The Scout plugin does not collect or process any personal data.
Afterwards, the plugin is being downloaded from the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13393-eclipse-scout[JetBrains Marketplace] and installed locally.
As soon as this is completed, press the `Restart IDE` button.

The same can also be achieved by navigating to `File | Settings | Plugins` in case you already have an existing IntelliJ project running.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up IntelliJ IDEA for Scout development.
