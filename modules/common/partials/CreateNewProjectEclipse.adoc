Start your Eclipse IDE and select an empty directory for your workspace as shown in <<img-sdk_start_new_workspace>>.
This workspace directory will then hold all the project code for the `Hello Scout` application.
Once the Eclipse IDE is running, it will show the Java perspective.

To create a new Scout project, select the menu menu:File[New,Project...] and type `Scout Project` in the wizard search field.
Select the Scout Project wizard and press btn:[Next].
The [wizard]_New Scout Project_ wizard is then started as shown in <<img-sdk_new_project_wizard>>.

In the [wizard]_New Scout Project_ wizard you have to enter a `Group Id`, `Artifact Id` and a `Display Name` for your Scout project.
As the created project will make use of https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven], please refer to the https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html[Maven naming conventions] to choose  `Group Id` and `Artifact Id` for your project.
The `Display Name` is used as the application name presented to the user (e.g. in the browser title bar).

For the `Hello Scout` application just use the already pre-filled values and ensure the user interface programming language is set to `Java` as sown in <<img-sdk_new_project_wizard>>.
Then click the btn:[Finish] button to let the Scout SDK create the initial project code for you.

Depending on your Eclipse installation, some `Maven plugin connectors` may initially be missing.
In that case, a dialog as shown in <<img-sdk_new_project_connector>> appears.
In order to resolve the selected connectors and continue, click on btn:[Finish].
Afterwards, confirm the installation, accept the license and the message that some content has not been signed.
Finally, the installation of the maven plugin connectors requires a restart of the Eclipse IDE.

After the [wizard]_New Scout Project_ wizard has created the Maven modules for the `Hello Scout` application, the code is compiled by the Eclipse IDE.
You can see the created Maven modules in the `Package Explorer` as shown in <<img-sdk_new_project_initial_helloworld>>.

After the compilation, you can start the Scout application for the first time.
Since the `Hello Scout` app consists of a backend and a frontend, two servers need to be started.
Before the frontend server can deliver any JavaScript code to the browser, the JavaScript build needs to be executed as well.
You could start each launch configuration separately, but for the sake of convenience there is a launch group available which starts all at once.

To start the launch group use the [menu]_Run As_ menu as shown in <<img-start_all>>.

IMPORTANT: The JavaScript build fails in case the installed Node.js was not found or is too old.
In that case, follow the instructions in the section <<Prerequisites>>.

Once the JS build has been completed successfully, the frontend and backend servers will be started automatically.
The servers are ready as soon as the console shows `Server ready`.
You can now access the `Hello Scout` application by navigating to http://localhost:8082/ in your favorite web browser.

The `Hello Scout` application is then presented as shown in <<img-start_browser>>.
