= Icons
include::common:partial$_header.adoc[]

A lot of Scout widgets support icons. For instance a menu item can show an icon
next to the menu text. Icons in Scout can be either a bitmap image (GIF, PNG,
JPEG, etc.), an SVG or a character from an icon-font. An example for an icon-font is
the _scoutIcons.woff_ which comes shipped with Scout.

It's a good practice to define the available icons in your application in a
class that defines each icon as a constant. Create a class `Icons` in the shared
module of your project. These constants should be references, when you set the
_IconId_ property in your code.

For bitmap images you simply specify the filename of the image file _without_
the file extension. Place all your icon files in the resource folder of your
_client_ module. Assuming your project name is "org.scout.hello", the correct
location to store icon files would be:

 org.scout.hello.client/              # Client project directory
   src/main/resources/                # Resources directory
     org/scout/hello/client/icons/    # Path to icons
       application_logo.png
       person.png
       ...

[source,java]
.Icons.java
----
// Bitmap image (references icons/application_logo.png)
public static final String ApplicationLogo = "application_logo";

// Character from icon-font scoutIcons.woff (default)
public static final String Calendar ="font:\uE003";

// Character from a custom icon-font
public static final String Phone ="font:awesomeIcons \uF095";

== Font Icons

The icons used by Scout itself are mainly font icons.
Even though font icons are scalable, an icon can get very thick when the size is increased, which is not always desired.
To overcome that, Scout icons come in 2 flavors: regular and light.

The regular icons can be used, if the icon is displayed at about 16px.
This is the case for most widgets (menu, button etc.)
If the icon should be displayed larger, the light icons can be used.

To use a light icon for your custom widget, just set the font-weight to `@icon-font-weight-light`.

If you create a custom icon font (or use an existing one), you may want to use icons that are compatible with the Scout icons in terms of line width.
This allows you to use the Scout icons and your custom icons side by side.
Alternatively, only use your custom icons and forget about the Scout icons.

The scout icons use the following dimensions:

* Regular: 1.5px line width and 24px artboard height
* Light: 1px line width and 24px artboard height

== Using a custom icon font

You can use your own icon font. The required file format for an icon font is
_.woff_. For the following examples we assume the name of your font file is
_awesomeIcons.woff_. The following steps are required:

Place the font file in the WebContent/fonts directory of your _html.ui_ module.
This makes it available for http requests on the URL
`http://[base]/fonts/awesomeIcons.woff`.

Create a CSS/LESS definition to reference the icon font in stylesheets (e.g. in a file called `fonts.less`). Make
sure the definition is added to the `index.less` of your project.

[source,less]
.The CSS/LESS font definition should look like this:
----
@font-face {
  font-family: awesomeIcons;
  font-weight: normal;
  src: url('fonts/awesomeIcons.woff') format('woff');
}

/* Overrides definitions in fonts.css > .font-icon
* Use iconId 'font:awesomeIcons [character]' in Scout model.
* See icons.js and usage of this class to see how iconId is used.
*/
.font-awesomeIcons {
  font-family: awesomeIcons, @font-default-family;
}
----

To check if your CSS definition is correct, you should download the CSS file
directly via URL and check if the CSS file contains the required font definition.
Have a look at your `index.html` to find the path to your CSS (e.g. `http://[base]/yourapp-theme.css`).

NOTE: When you request resources from the _WebContent_ folder via http, Scout will
find resources from other modules on the classpath too. Thus the _scoutIcons.woff_ is
always available in a Scout project. However, you must avoid naming conflicts,
since at runtime all files exist on the same classpath.

== How to create a custom icon font
Here's what we do to create and maintain our own icon font _scoutIcons.woff_.
There may be other methods to achieve the same.

To create and modify our icon font we use the online application https://icomoon.io/app/[IcoMoon].
IcoMoon allows you to assemble a set of icons from various sources (e.g.
FontAwesome or custom SVG graphics) and create a font file from that set.

You can export/import your icon set from and to IcoMoon, and you should store
the files exported from IcoMoon in a SCM system like GIT. IcoMoon stores all
important data in the file _selection.json_. Make sure you also store the raw
SVG graphics you've uploaded to IcoMoon in your SCM, in case you have to change
a single icon later.

To edit the icon font in IcoMoon follow these steps:

* Import _selection.json_ in IcoMoon, click on the "Import Icons" button.
* With the _Select_ tool (arrow) you select the icons you want to add to your
  set. You can also add one or more characters from other icon fonts like
  FontAwesome by choosing _Add Icons From Library..._
* Your can import your custom SVG graphics with _Import to Set_, which you find
  in the hamburger menu on the icon set. The SVG graphic should have the same
  size as the other icons in the set and  must use only a single color,
  black. The background must be transparent. Hint: the filename of the SVG
  graphic should contain the unicode of the character in the font in order to
  simplify maintencance. Only use unicodes from the _Private Use Area_ from
  U+E000 to U+F8FF.
* When you're happy with your icon set, you hit the _Generate Font_ button in
  the footer in IcoMoon. On the following page you can set the unicode of
  each icon/character. Click on the prefences button (cog icon), to set the
  name of your icon font (e.g. scoutIcons). Finally click on _Download_ and
  you receive a ZIP file which contains the new _selection.json_, and font files
  like .ttf and .woff.
* When you've added new unicodes to the icon font, you should also update
   _Icons.java_ and add constants for the new characters. When you're using
   _Scout JS_ you should also update _icons.js_ and _icons.less_.
* *Important!* don't forget to check in the new _selection.js_ to your SCM.

=== Tools
* Windows tool _Character Map_: first you must install your custom TrueType Font
  .ttf in Windows. Simply double-click on the .ttf file and choose _Install_.
  After that you can start _Character Map_ and browse through the font.
* The ZIP archive from IcoMoon contains a file _demo.html_. This file shows a
  preview of your icon font. Works in Chrome, but we had trouble viewing the
  font with Firefox.
* This tool from Wikipedia also creates a preview for an icon font: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorlage:Private-Use-Area-Test[Vorlage:Private-Use-Area-Test].
  Icon font must be installed first.
