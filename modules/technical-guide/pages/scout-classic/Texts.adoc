include::common:partial$_header.adoc[]

The `TEXTS` class is a convenience class to access the default Text Provider Service used for the localization of the texts in the user interface.

[source,java]
.Text lookup
----
TEXTS.get("persons");
----

Its also possible to use some parameters:

[source,java]
.Text lookup
----
String name = "Bob";
int age = 13;

TEXTS.get("NameWithAge", name, age);
----

In this case, some placeholders for the parameters are needed in the translated text:

[source,java]
.Text lookup
----
 NameWithAge={0} is {1} years old;
----

== Text properties files

Scout uses the java.util.ResourceBundle mechanism for native language support. So whatever language files you have in your `<project-prefix>.shared/resources/texts/*.properties` are taken as translation base.

Example setup:

* <project-prefix>.shared/resources/texts/Texts.properties
* <project-prefix>.shared/resources/texts/Texts_fr.properties

If your application starts with the `-vmargs -Duser.language=fr` or `eclipse.exe -nl=fr` the translations in Texts_fr.properties are considered.
In case of any other user language the translations in Texts.properties are considered.

It is possible to edit these files in the Eclipse Scout SDK with the NLS Editor.

== Text Provider Service

Text Provider Services are services responsible to provide localization for texts in the user interface. A typical application contains a such service contributed by the Shared Project.

* implements: `ITextProviderService`
* extends: `AbstractDynamicNlsTextProviderService` (default, translations are stored in properties files)

Using Text Provider Services developers can decide to store the translations in a custom container like a database or XML files. Furthermore using TextProviderServices it is very easy to overwrite any translated text in the application (also texts used in Scout itself) using the service ranking.

The mechanism is aligned with the icon retrieval which is also managed using https://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php?title=Scout/Concepts/Icon_Provider_Service&action=edit&redlink=1[Icon Provider Services].

=== Localization using .properties files

By default the internationalization mechanism relies on .properties files using a reference implementation of the TextProviderServices:

Service extending the `AbstractDynamicNlsTextProviderService` class.

A Text Provider Service working with the default implementation need to define where the properties files are located.
This is realized by overriding the getter getDynamicNlsBaseName(). Here an example:

[source,java]
.Text lookup
----
  @Override
  protected String getDynamicNlsBaseName() {
    return "resources.texts.Texts";
  }
----

If configured like this, it means that the .properties files will be located in the same plug-in at the location:

* `/resources/texts/Texts.properties` (default)
* `/resources/texts/Texts_fr.properties` (french)
* `/resources/texts/Texts_de.properties` (german)
* `...` (additional languages)

If you decide to store your translated texts in .properties files, you migth want to use the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Scout/SDK/NLS_Editor[NLS Editor] to edit them.

You need to respect the format defined by the Java Properties class. In particular the encoding of a .properties file is ISO-8859-1 (also known as Latin-1). All non-Latin-1 characters must be encoded. Examples:

 'à' => "\u00E0"
 'ç' => "\u00E7"
 'ß' => "\u00DF"

The encoding is the "Unicode escape characters": \uHHHH where HHHH is a hexadecimal id of the character in the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters[Unicode character table]. Read more on the .properties File on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties[wikipedia].

=== File Watcher

The `NlsFileWatcher` observes changes in text property files.
If a change in a text property file occurs, the nls resource bundle cache will be invalidated.
This means that there is no need to restart the server when working on texts and translations.
The file watcher is only active if `scout.devMode=true` is set and can be disabled with `scout.dev.texts.fileWatcherEnabled=false`.
By default, the file watcher is enabled in development mode.
