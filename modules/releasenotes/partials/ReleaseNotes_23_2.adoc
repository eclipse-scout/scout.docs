== Improved Developer Experience for Scout JS

Scout 23.2 contains many improvements for Scout JS developers.
The goal was to make the development easier, more efficient and more fun.
Please read the following chapters to learn how we did it.

=== MenuTypes

==== Default menuTypes

Default menuTypes have been added to several widgets.
This means that e.g. the `Table` treats a menu without a menuType as if it had set `Table.MenuTypes.EmptySpace`.
For more information about the default menuTypes see link:{techdocjs}#menu-types[Technical Guide for Scout JS].

== CollapsStyle for Group CustomHeader

The Group.CollapseStyle property is applied on a custom headers, that can be used in the group. Without the property set, the default CollapsStyle is left.
