When a new Scout release begins:

- Adjust constants and paths containing a version-number in "ReleaseNotes.adoc".

- Increment version-number in file "release-notes-[n].0.adoc", then delete content from previous release.

- Clean-up ./images folder and delete all files in it. They are not referenced anymore.
