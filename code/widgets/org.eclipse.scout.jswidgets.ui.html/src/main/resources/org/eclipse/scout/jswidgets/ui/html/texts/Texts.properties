AboutText=Made with Eclipse Scout {0}.\r\n<p>\r\nPlease see <a href\="https\://eclipsescout.github.io/">https\://eclipsescout.github.io</a> for documentation and other resources.\r\n</p>

AddRow=Add row
AnchorBoundsTooltip=If set, the popup will use the given bounds as anchor. The format is\: x,y,width,height
AppDescription=Here you will find a demonstration of the Scout JS widgets. You can try them out and get a feel of how they are used. You should also try to adjust some properties and see what happens. Every widget comes with default settings but most of them are configurable to serve different purposes.\n<p>\nEvery widget page is structured the same way\: You will find the widget itself on top of the page. On the bottom is the configuration area where you can adjust the properties, execute actions or listen for events.\n<p>\nIn fact this application is not only supposed to show you the widgets but may also serve you as API reference. You can see what is possible and how the widgets are used.\n<p>\nAll the code is available on <a href\="https\://github.com/BSI-Business-Systems-Integration-AG/org.eclipse.scout.docs/tree/releases/{0}.x/code/widgets/org.eclipse.scout.jswidgets.ui.html">GitHub</a>.\n<p>\nYou should also check out the documentation about Scout JS in the <a href\="https\://eclipsescout.github.io/{0}/technical-guide-js.html">technical guide</a>.\n<p>\nHave fun\!\n

AutoResizeColumnsTooltip=If set, the columns will take all the available width of the table. The configured width of the columns is used as weight for the width calculation and also as minimal width.
BlockFormatTooltip=Using a formatter and parser you can adjust the text the user typed.\r\nTry it by selecting this check box and entering a long string into the string field (like 12345678).

EventLog=Event Log

EventsOverview=Every widget can trigger events. Events are the result of actions, like clicking a button or deleting a row in a table. Changing a property will result in an event, too, a so called property change event.\n<br>You can listen for events by attaching an event handler. The event log below uses such an event handler and displays every triggered event for this widget. Try to interact with the widget or adjust some properties and see what happens.\n<p>\nCheck out the <a href\="https\://eclipsescout.github.io/{0}/technical-guide-js.html\#events">technical guide</a> for more details.\n</p>

GroupBoxScrollableTooltip=If set, the group box will show vertical scrollbars when it is too small to display all the content. If the property is not set explicitly, only the main box will be scrollable by default.\r\n\r\nWhen setting the property to true, remember to fix the height of the group box because the group box is by default as height as its content (useUiHeight is true).

HasCloseButton=Has close button
HasCloseButtonTooltip=If the form has a close button, pressing the "x" icon will call close(), otherwise cancel() is called which will show a message if there are unsaved changes.
HierarchicalTableField=Hierarchical Table Field
LabelFieldValue=This is the value of a label field
LabelValue=The purpose of this simple widget is to display text, either plain text or HTML text. HTML tags are encoded by default, so if you would like to display HTML content you need to set the property <i>htmlEnabled</i> to true. Try it out now to make the encoded tags in this text disappear.<br>\r\nA label is also able to display app links. App links create an event when clicked which you can listen for and execute an action. The following link is an app link\: <span class\="app-link" data-ref\="link_ref">Click me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease note\: a label is not the same as a label field. A label field extends 'ValueField' and is a form field whereas the label is a simple widget. If you work with forms you should be using 'LabelField', if you work with plain widgets you can use a 'Label'.
LanguageTagShort=Tag
LifecycleData=Life cycle data

TileGridVirtualTooltip=Virtual relates to the term "Virtual Scrolling". This means, only the tiles in the view port and some more will be rendered. The others will be rendered as soon as they will be moved into the view port, either by scrolling or by any other action like sorting, filtering etc.\r\n\r\nThis can lead to a big performance boost when having many tiles, especially on Internet Explorer, but other browsers benefit as well.\r\n\r\nTo make Virtual Scrolling work, the real width and height needs to be known so that scroll bar position can be calculated correctly. This means Virtual Scrolling does only work if all tiles have the same size, so the following grid properties cannot be used\: useUiWidth, useUiHeight, widthInPixel, heightInPixel, w, h, x, y.\r\n\r\nIf these preconditions are given, you can use the virtual mode and your grid will be able to handle a lot of tiles.
TileTypeTooltip=The type of newly inserted tiles.\r\n\r\nThe content and visualization of a tile heavily depends on the use case. If you just want to display some data in a tile grid without the need of a custom styling and elaborated tile layout you can use a HtmlTile with the default display style.\r\n\r\nIf you want more control over the styling, just set a custom CSS class and add some rules. If you don't like the default rules you can also set the display style to PLAIN so that these default styles are not applied.\r\n\r\nIf you want even more control about the layout and content you can create a custom tile instead of using the HtmlTile as it is done here with CustomTile.js.
