AppDescription=Here you will find a demonstration of the Scout JS widgets. You can try them out and get a feel of how they are used. You should also try to adjust some properties and see what happens. Every widget comes with default settings but most of them are configurable to serve different purposes.\n<p>\nEvery widget page is structured the same way\: You will find the widget itself on top of the page. On the bottom is the configuration area where you can adjust the properties, execute actions or listen for events.\n<p>\nIn fact this application is not only supposed to show you the widgets but may also serve you as API reference. You can see what is possible and how the widgets are used.\n<p>\nAll the code is available on <a href\="https\://github.com/BSI-Business-Systems-Integration-AG/org.eclipse.scout.docs/tree/releases/{0}.x/code/widgets/org.eclipse.scout.jswidgets.ui.html">GitHub</a>.\n<p>\nYou should also check out the documentation about Scout JS in the <a href\="https\://eclipsescout.github.io/{0}/technical-guide-js.html\">technical guide</a>.\n<p>\nHave fun\!\n

The event log below uses such an event handler and displays every triggered event for this widget. Try to interact with the widget or adjust some properties and see what happens.\n<p>\nCheck out the <a href\="https\://eclipsescout.github.io/{0}/technical-guide-js.html\#events">technical guide</a> for more details.\n</p>
