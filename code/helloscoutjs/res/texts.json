You should also try to adjust some properties and see what happens. Every widget comes with default settings but most of them are configurable to serve different purposes.\n<p>\nEvery widget page is structured the same way: You will find the widget itself on top of the page. On the bottom is the configuration area where you can adjust the properties, execute actions or listen for events.\n<p>\nIn fact this application is not only supposed to show you the widgets but may also serve you as API reference. You can see what is possible and how the widgets are used.\n<p>\nAll the code is available on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bsi-software\/org.eclipse.scout.docs\/tree\/releases\/{0}.x\/code\/widgets\/org.eclipse.scout.jswidgets.ui.html\">GitHub<\/a>.\n<p>\nYou should also check out the documentation about Scout JS in the <a href=\"https:\/\/eclipsescout.github.io\/{0}\/technical-guide-js.html\">technical guide<\/a>.\n<p>\nHave fun!\n",

The others will be rendered as soon as they will be moved into the view port, either by scrolling or by any other action like sorting, filtering etc.\r\n\r\nThis can lead to a big performance boost when having many tiles, especially on Internet Explorer, but other browsers benefit as well.\r\n\r\nTo make Virtual Scrolling work, the real width and height needs to be known so that scroll bar position can be calculated correctly. This means Virtual Scrolling does only work if all tiles have the same size, so the following grid properties cannot be used: useUiWidth, useUiHeight, widthInPixel, heightInPixel, w, h, x, y.\r\n\r\nIf these preconditions are given, you can use the virtual mode and your grid will be able to handle a lot of tiles.",
    "TileTypeTooltip": "The type of newly inserted tiles.\r\n\r\nThe content and visualization of a tile heavily depends on the use case. If you just want to display some data in a tile grid without the need of a custom styling and elaborated tile layout you can use a HtmlTile with the default display style.\r\n\r\nIf you want more control over the styling, just set a custom CSS class and add some rules. If you don't like the default rules you can also set the display style to PLAIN so that these default styles are not applied.\r\n\r\nIf you want even more control about the layout and content you can create a custom tile instead of using the HtmlTile as it is done here with CustomTile.js.",
