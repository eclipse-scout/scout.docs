[[iid-signature]]
== IId signature

This release introduces a mechanism to add signatures to `IId` that are e.g. sent to the browser or provided by a REST endpoint.

[[multiple-calendars]]
== Calendar Widget: Support for Multiple Calendars

The calendar widget is now capable of handling multiple calendar resources. In the left sidebar of the calendar appears a widget, which allows choosing the current visible resources.

By using a `CalendarResourceDo` object, new resources can be defined and added to the widget. These are the most important properties of the DataObject:

[%header,cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Property name
|Type
|Description

|resourceId
|UUID (String)
|The unique identifier of a resource

|name
|String
|The display name of the resource

|parentId
|UUID (String)
|A resource can be a member of a resource group. If so, this property references the UUID of the resource group. A resource group is a normal `CalendarResourceDo` object.

|visible
|Boolean
|Indicates, if the resource is currently visible. This property changes when the user shows/hides the resource in the sidebar.

|selectable
|Boolean
|Indicates, if a range selection on this resource can be performed in the day view.
|===

A `CalendarResourceDo` can be added to the calendar by using `ICalendar#setResources` or `AbstractCalendar#getConfiguredResources`.

A calendar item can be assigned to a resource by referencing the resource by its ID using `ICalendarItem#setResourceId`.

When a CalendarItemProvider only produces items for one specific calendar, the method `AbstractCalendarItemProvider#getConfiguredAssociatedResource` can be overridden. All items produced by it are automatically assigned to the specified resource.
