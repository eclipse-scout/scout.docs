[[iid-signature]]
== IId signature

This release introduces a mechanism to add signatures to `IId` that are e.g. sent to the browser or provided by a REST endpoint.
For more information see xref:technical-guide:common-concepts/security.adoc#iid-signature[IId signature].

[[multiple-calendars]]
== Calendar: Support for Multiple Calendars

The calendar widget is now capable of handling multiple calendar resources. In the left sidebar of the calendar appears a widget, which allows choosing the current visible resources.

By using a `CalendarResourceDo` object, new resources can be defined and added to the widget. These are the most important properties of the DataObject:

[%header,cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Property name
|Type
|Description

|resourceId
|UUID (String)
|The unique identifier of a resource

|name
|String
|The display name of the resource

|parentId
|UUID (String)
|A resource can be a member of a resource group. If so, this property references the UUID of the resource group. A resource group is a normal `CalendarResourceDo` object.

|visible
|Boolean
|Indicates, if the resource is currently visible. This property changes when the user shows/hides the resource in the sidebar.

|selectable
|Boolean
|Indicates, if a range selection on this resource can be performed in the day view.
|===

A `CalendarResourceDo` can be added to the calendar by using `ICalendar#setResources` or `AbstractCalendar#getConfiguredResources`.

A calendar item can be assigned to a resource by referencing the resource by its ID using `ICalendarItem#setResourceId`.

When a CalendarItemProvider only produces items for one specific calendar, the method `AbstractCalendarItemProvider#getConfiguredAssociatedResource` can be overridden. All items produced by it are automatically assigned to the specified resource.

== Max Row Count and Limited Result for Scout JS Pages

Pages written in TypeScript now support a maximum row count and inform the user if there would be more data than allowed to fetch (limited result).
If you want to use this feature for your Scout JS pages as well, follow these instructions in the xref:migration:migration-guide.adoc#limitedResult[Migration Guide].

== Access Config Properties from Scout JS

Selected config properties can now be accessed from Scout JS.
See the xref:technical-guide:common-concepts/platform.adoc#access-config-ts[Configuration documentation] on how to expose more properties to the browser and how to access them from TypeScript.

== Tile Grid

=== Movable (Scout JS)

Tiles can now be marked as "movable", see `TileModel.movable`.
This allows them to be moved to another position using drag & drop.

Please note that this feature is only available for Scout JS based tile grids.

=== Resizable (Scout JS)

Tiles can now be marked as "resizable", see `TileModel.resizable`.
This allows them to be resized by grabbing an edge or corner of the tile.

Please note that this feature is only available for Scout JS based tile grids.

=== Wrappable

The wrapping behavior of a tile grid can now be disabled using the new `wrappable` property.

If you don't need your grid to wrap the tiles you can consider disabling it which may slightly improve the performance.

=== Tile: AnimateBoundsChange

The new property makes it possible to disable the animation for size and position changes for a specific tile.

== Logical Grid

=== Max Width and Height (Scout JS)

The logical grid now supports the new grid data properties `maxWidthInPixel` and `maxHeightInPixel`.
As the names imply these properties make it possible to limit the size of a grid cell.

=== Spy

If you are curious how the logical grid works or have problems arranging your widgets inside a logical grid, the new logical grid spy may help you to understand it better.

Please see xref:technical-guide:user-interface/logical-grid.adoc#logical-grid-spy[Logical Grid Spy] for more information on how to enable it.

=== Clone Method (Scout JS)

With the new clone method on the `GridData` object you can modify the grid data hints of a widget a lot easier.

[source,typescript]
----
widget.setGridDataHints(widget.gridDataHints.clone({h: 2}))
----

This also helps adjusting the grid data hints on the fly for debugging purposes in the developer tools of your browser.

=== Event for Grid Data Property Change

Form fields and tiles now trigger a property change event whenever the calculated grid data object changes.
