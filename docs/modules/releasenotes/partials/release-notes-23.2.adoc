== Scout JS

=== Multi Dimension Support

Similar to Scout Classic, Scout JS now also supports multidimensional properties.

A multidimensional property is a property that will be computed based on its dimensions.

For example: `Widget.visible` is now multidimensional and computed based on the `default` and the `granted` dimension.
Both dimensions need to be true to make the widget visible. This means, if a widget is made invisible using `widget.setVisibleGranted(false)`, calling `widget.setVisible(true)` (which will modify the default dimension) won't have any effect.

This feature makes it easy to really hide a widget that the user is not allowed to see without fearing that it could be made visible accidentally.

To learn more about this, see xref:technical-guide:user-interface/multi-dimensions.adoc[].

=== Form

[#modal-optional-for-views]
==== Modal Optional for Views

Until now, the default value for `modal` was true.
This has been changed so that the default now depends on the `displayStyle`:
It is still true for `Form.DisplayStyle.Dialog`, but false for `Form.DisplayStyle.View`.

This means if you require your view to be `modal`, set it to true. Otherwise, you can remove the setting.

The reason why this was changed is, because it is less common to have modal views, which also aligns it with the behavior of Scout Classic.

==== SaveNeeded State Updated Automatically

The property `saveNeededVisible` now correctly visualizes if the form needs to be saved.
The default for this property is true for Scout JS forms.
For Scout Classic forms the default has not been changed and is still false.

For this, the form now has a property called `saveNeeded` that will be updated automatically if the `saveNeeded` state on any child field changes (please note that the property on the form field was renamed from `requiresSave` to `saveNeeded`, see xref:migration:migration-guide.adoc#rename-requiressave-to-saveneeded[Migration Guide]).

==== New Property 'checkSaveNeeded' on Form Fields

Sometimes the `saveNeeded` state is not of interest and should not affect the `saveNeeded` state of the form.
This may be the case for fields that contain data that doesn't need to be saved. For this kind of fields, the `saveNeeded` computation can now be disabled by setting `checkSaveNeeded` to false.

[#visitfields-across-field-trees]
==== VisitFields Across Field Trees

The method `FormField.visitFields` now also visits form fields that are not directly connected to a parent form field.
Example: a form field inside a menu. This was necessary to properly detect `saveNeeded` changes of such fields and validate them when a form is stored. If you need the old behavior, consult the xref:migration:migration-guide.adoc#formfield-visitfields-now-visits-deeper[Migration Guide]).

==== Open Exclusive Support

A form can now be opened exclusively.
This means, you can define an exclusive key for a form, and if another form should be opened with the same key, the first form will be activated instead of opening the second one.

To open a form exclusively, use `createFormExclusive` on the `Desktop` and open the form as usual using `form.open()`.

==== Error handling for save and load

The `load`, `postLoad` and `save` operations of a Scout JS form include automatic error handling now.
Custom logic to handle errors (e.g. from REST calls) are in most cases no longer necessary and can therefore be removed.

Refer to the xref:migration:migration-guide.adoc#form-error-handling[Migration Guide] on how to customize the new default error handling in case you need some special behavior.

=== MenuTypes

==== Default menuTypes

Default menuTypes have been added to several widgets.
This means that e.g. the `Table` treats a menu without a menuType as if it had set `Table.MenuType.EmptySpace`.
For more information about the default menuTypes see xref:technical-guide:user-interface/widget-reference.adoc#menu-types[MenuTypes].

=== SmartFields: Error-Handling for Key-Lookups

Before this change: If a key-lookup inside a SmartField didn't return a result, the SmartField was presented to the user like no value has been chosen.
Internally, however, the (most likely invalid) value was still set on the SmartField.
Hence, the user couldn't see that the current value is invalid and a new value should be set.

This change puts a warning status on the SmartField if a key-lookup doesn't return a value.

Because of the potential consequences, this change was implemented for ScoutJS only (not for Scout Classic).

[#busy-handling]
=== Busy handling

The busy handling has been simplified for Scout JS.
A new class `BusySupport` has been introduced which should be used instead of directly creating a `BusyIndicator`.
Features:

* multiple nested busy calls possible
* cancellation callbacks
* delayed rendering support

It can be accessed using `Desktop.setBusy` (the Desktop is available on the Session) or `Form.setBusy`.
Typically, it should not be necessary to create own `BusySupport` instances.

In case you created custom busy handling, refer to the xref:migration:migration-guide.adoc#busy-handling[Migration Guide] on how to migrate.

=== Access Control

Scout JS now supports permissions. It provides the possibility and convenience of checking permissions using the `access` utility.
For more information about the `access` utility see xref:technical-guide:common-concepts/security.adoc#scoutjs[Authorization (Scout JS)].

== SDK

The Scout IntelliJ plugins have been improved to better support Scout JS development and working with xref:technical-guide:working-with-data/data-object.adoc[Data Objects].

=== Code Completion for TypeScript Based UI Models

To get the code completion for UI models, just start writing or press kbd:[Ctrl,Space].

==== Creating new Fields

Easily create a new `FormField`, `Menu`, `Column` and more Scout objects.

=== WidgetMap Generation

xref:technical-guide:user-interface/widget.adoc#widget-maps[Widget Maps] have been introduced with Scout 23.1. Now, you can use the SDK to create the maps. Just use the menu entry or press the keystroke kbd:[Ctrl,Alt,Shift,W] to create the maps for the current model file. You can also create all maps in a certain scope or for the whole project.

=== DO Templates

The SDK now contains templates to easily modify xref:technical-guide:working-with-data/data-object.adoc[Data Objects]. Just start writing `do` or use kbd:[Ctrl,J] for a complete list of all templates.
