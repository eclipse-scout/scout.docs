When a new Scout release begins:

- Adjust constants and paths containing a version-number in "release-notes.adoc".

- Increment version-number in file "release-notes-[n].adoc", then delete content from previous release.

- Clean-up ./images folder and delete all files in it. They are not referenced anymore.
