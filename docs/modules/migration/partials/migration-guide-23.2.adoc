// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== New 3rd Party requirements

To update your application the following steps might be required:

* Update the version of the `maven_rt_plugin_config-master` in your `pom.xml` files to the newest `23.2.x` release.
See https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.eclipse.scout/maven_rt_plugin_config-master[Maven central] for a list of versions available.
* Update the Scout versions (`package.json` and `pom.xml`) as shown in <<Obtaining the Latest Version>>.
* If you are using Eclipse and web-service providers, update the `.factorypath` files as shown in xref:technical-guide:working-with-data/jax-ws.adoc#jax-ws-appendix[JAX-WS Appendix].

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Utilities

=== DateUtility: New Default Date Time Format

Since this version, the method `DateUtility#formatDateTime` returns the date formatted with the `DateFormat.DEFAULT` and no longer with the `DateFormat.SHORT`.
Now, both methods, `DateUtility#formatDate` and `DateUtility#formatDateTime`, are formatting the date identically.
To apply the old formatting, use `DateUtility#formatDateTimeShort`.

=== New ExceptionUtility

A set of utility methods dealing with `Exception` and `Throwable` were moved and added to the new `ExceptionUtility`.

Change invocations of `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.exception.ExceptionHandler.getRootCause()`
to the new utility method  `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.util.ExceptionUtility.getRootCause()`.

== Adapted REST ErrorDoRestClientExceptionTransformer

The transformation logic for exceptions which occur while invoking a REST client was slightly adapted.
For HTTP error codes 502 (bad gateway), 503 (service unavailable) and 504 (gateway timeout) the adapted `ErrorDoRestClientExceptionTransformer` returns a `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.exception.RemoteSystemUnavailableException` instead of the former generic `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.exception.ProcessingException`.

== Removed Deprecated Code

The following functions were deprecated in a previous release and are now removed completely.

* TabBox.ts: `selectTabById`, replaced by `setSelectedTab`
* JQueryMouseWheelEvent: instead of using `DOMMouseScroll mousewheel` events use `wheel` and JQueryWheelEvent type
* Menu.ts: `addChildActions`, replaced by `insertChildActions`
* Widget.ts: `_isRemovalPending`, replaced by `isRemovalPending`
* CompositeFieldUtility.java: `moveFieldTo`, third parameter removed
* AbstractExtensionChain.java: `callChain`, vararg removed
* AbstractDataModelOperatorField.java: setAttribute, second parameter is not optional anymore
* FocusManager.ts: `requestFocus` does not accept a boolean anymore as third parameter

== Removal of Public Holiday Calendar Support

A few classes used to read public holidays from an XML file and providing them to the calendar were removed without replacement:

** `org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.ui.basic.calendar.provider.AbstractHolidayItemProvider`
** `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.services.common.calendar.IHolidayCalendarService`
** `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.services.common.calendar.HolidayCalendarService`
** `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.services.common.calendar.HolidayItem`
** `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.services.common.calendar.HolidayCalendarItemParser`

== Health Check Servlet

The logic of executing health checks was extracted from `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.AbstractHealthCheckServlet` and moved to an own `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.HealthCheckService`.

The `AbstractHealthCheckServlet` is no longer abstract, was renamed to `HealthCheckServlet` and may be used without further individualization.

To update to the new servlet, the following changes in your `web.xml` are necessary:

* UI Server: Replace `org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html.admin.healthcheck.UiHealthCheckServlet` with `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.HealthCheckServlet` in your `web.xml`
* Backend Server: Replace `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.admin.healthcheck.ServerHealthCheckServlet` with `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.HealthCheckServlet` in your `web.xml`

== Removed unused NLS texts

The following NLS texts were unused within the Scout framework and removed:

* ButtonDeselectAll
* ButtonSelectAll
* ErrorTextLogin
* ErrorTextSecurity
* ErrorTitleLogin
* FileNotFoundMessage
* FormIncompleteIntro
* IOErrorInfo
* IOErrorText
* IOErrorTitle
* LogicTimeIsInGEHours
* LogicTimeIsInGEMinutes
* LogicTimeIsInHours
* LogicTimeIsInLEHours
* LogicTimeIsInLEMinutes
* LogicTimeIsInMinutes
* LogicTimeIsNotNow
* LogicTimeIsNow
* NetErrorInfo
* NetErrorText
* NoSorting
* OriginalErrorMessageIs
* VetoErrorText
* WeekShort
* Without
* searchingProposals

== Adapt Planner properties

`Planner.selectionMode` is removed. The properties `Planner.rangeSelectable` and `Planner.multiSelect` should be used instead. To get the same behavior as before, the modes should be translated as follows:

* SELECTION_MODE_NONE -> `Planner.rangeSelectable = false` and `Planner.multiSelect = false`
* SELECTION_MODE_SINGLE_RANGE -> `Planner.rangeSelectable = true` and `Planner.multiSelect = false`
* SELECTION_MODE_MULTI_RANGE -> `Planner.rangeSelectable = true` and `Planner.multiSelect = true`

With `Planner.rangeSelectable = false` and `Planner.multiSelect = true` its now possible to select multiple rows even if no range is selectable. In addition, if multiple rows are selectable, the selected rows no longer have to be next to each other.

== .properties Files using UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)

`.properties` files, including, but not limited to

* Text properties (NLS)
* Config properties
* User preferences via `FileSystemUserPreferencesStorageService`

are now using UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1 encoding.

Existing files need to be converted, e.g. by the help of `native2ascii`, which is available up to (but not including) JDK 17.
Execute the following command in your workspace directory:

....
find . -name "*.properties" -exec native2ascii -reverse -encoding utf8 {} {} \;
....

It's recommended to check calls to

* Properties#load
* Properties#store

and make sure that the `Reader`/`Writer` overload is used instead of the one with `InputStream`/`OutputStream` and that UTF-8 encoding is used for the reader/writer.
Example:

[source,java]
----
try (InputStream stream = getClass().getResourceAsStream(filename); Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(stream, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {
  Properties properties = new Properties();
  properties.load(reader);
  // ...
}
----

Additionally, configure your IDE to use UTF-8 for `.properties` files too.

Eclipse: Window/Preferences/General/Content Types

* Text/Java Properties File
* Default encoding: `UTF-8` & press `Update`
** For sub entries too (e.g. Build Properties File, ...)

IntelliJ: File/Settings/Editor/File Encodings:

* Project Encoding: `UTF-8`
* Properties Files (*.properties)
** Default encoding for properties files: `UTF-8`
** [ ] Transparent native-to-ascii conversion: unchecked

In `.editorconfig`, remove the section for `*.properties`, e.g. remove

----
[*.properties]
charset = latin1 # latin1 = ISO-8859-1
----

Charset for `[*]` should already be set to `charset = utf-8`.

== CssClasses interface

The interface `org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.ui.CssClasses` was moved to `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.CssClasses`.
The old interface was left and marked `@Deprecated` for release 23/2 and will be removed in a future release.
Change your imports to the moved interface in order to avoid deprecation warnings.

== Use DataObjectHelper#cloneLenient within IDoValueMigrationHandler#migrate

`DataObjectMigrator` uses `ILenientDataObjectMapper` to create a typed representation of the given data object after structure migration and before calling value migrations.
For any implementation of a value migration working on a data object, most likely `DataObjectHelper#clone` is currently used to get a copy of the provided input argument.
`DataObjectHelper#cloneLenient` must be used instead.
There might be structural inconsistencies that are migrated by later value migrations.
`DataObjectHelper#clone` would fail in such scenarios, `DataObjectHelper#cloneLenient` won't.

== Scout JS

=== Multi Dimension Support

Since some properties on `Widget` and `Column` are now computed based on their dimensions, they must always be set using the corresponding setter.
Even though it was already bad practise to set a value without using the setter, it may have worked for your case if you didn't need a property change event or the property to be rendered.
If you do so now, you will replace the computed value instead of setting the default dimension, which may result in unexpected behavior.

Please check in your code, if you set the following properties directly and replace them with the corresponding setter.
[source,javascript]
----
Widget.visible = value -> Widget.setVisible(value)
Widget.enabled = value -> Widget.setEnabled(value)
Column.visible = value -> Column.setVisible(value)
Column.displayable = value -> Column.setDisplayable(value)
----

Furthermore, `Widget.isVisible()` and `Column.isVisible()` have been deprecated because the `visible` properties are now computed and there is no need for having `isVisible()` anymore.
Therefore, please use the property `visible` directly instead of calling `isVisible()`.

[source,javascript]
----
Widget.isVisible -> Widget.visible
Column.isVisible -> Column.visible
----

=== Tree: Insert Order Changed

`Tree.insertNodes` now adds new nodes (without an explicit childNodeIndex) at the bottom of the existing nodes instead of the top.
This is already the case for the Scout Classic tree, and also for other widgets like table and tile grid.

To insert the nodes at the beginning or any other position, you can use the new parameter `index`.

=== Form

==== Modal Optional for Views

The default value for the `modal` property has been changed for forms with `displayStyle` = `Form.DisplaStyle.VIEW`, see xref:releasenotes:release-notes.adoc#modal-optional-for-views[Release Notes].

==== Form Validation

The text to display when the Form validation failed has been moved from Lifecycle to Form:

* `Lifecycle.validationFailedTextKey` to `Form.validationFailedText` and use the `${textKey:TextKey}` notation to specify a text key
* `Lifecycle.validationFailedText` to `Form.validationFailedText`

The code to display a message box when the Form validation failed has been moved from Lifecycle to Form:

* `Lifecycle._showStatusMessageBox` to `Form._showFormInvalidMessageBox`
* `Lifecycle._createStatusMessageBox` to `Form._createStatusMessageBox`

[#form-error-handling]
==== Form Error Handling

The load, postLoad and save operations of a Scout JS Form include automatic error handling now.
Custom logic to handle errors (e.g. from REST calls) are in most cases no longer necessary and can therefore be removed.

If the default error handling does not suit your needs override one of the following methods:

* `_handleError`: to handle all phases (load, postLost, save)
* `_handleLoadError`: load errors only
* `_handlePostLoadError`: postLoad errors only
* `_handleSaveError`: save errors only

To customize the error handling from outside the form suppress the default handling using an event listener and apply your own logic in the catch:

[source,javascript]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
form.on('error', event => {
    if (event.phase === 'load') {
      event.preventDefault(); // disable default error handling for 'load' only
    }
});
form.open().catch(error => {
  // add your custom error handling logic here
});
----

As part of the new error handling the following methods changed its signature:

* `Form.validate` and `Lifecycle.validate`: Now return Promise<Status> instead of Promise<boolean>. The former boolean value can be obtained by calling isValid() on the new Status object.
* `Lifecycle.handle` now only takes a function returning Promise<void>. There is no need to return a Status anymore.
* `Form._onLifecycleLoad`, `Form._onLifecycleSave`, `Form._save`, `Form.save` and `Lifecycle._save`: now return Promise<void>. There is no need to return a Status anymore. A load/save failure should return a rejected Promise and a successful load/save should return a resolved promise. In case of an error the Promise might be rejected with any error or a Status describing the error.
* `Form._handleLoadError`: Returns Promise<void> which indicates that the error was handled. A rejected promise means the error could not be handled. In such a case no fallback is applied! It is therefore the developers responsibility to ensure the error was handled as desired.

==== FormField

[#rename-requiressave-to-saveneeded]
===== Rename requiresSave to saveNeeded

The property `requiresSave` and the function `updateRequiresSave` on the `FormField` have been renamed to `saveNeeded` resp. `updateSaveNeeded`.
This makes it consistent with the property `saveNeededVisible` on the Form and also with Scout Classic.

To migrate it is best to search for `requiresSave` resp. `RequiresSave` in your JS/TS code base and replace the occurrences accordingly.

[#formfield-visitfields-now-visits-deeper]
===== VisitFields Now Visits Deeper

The visiting is not limited to composite fields anymore which means more fields may be visited, see xref:releasenotes:release-notes.adoc#visitfields-across-field-trees[Release Notes]. If you need the old behavior, you can use the option `limitToSameFieldTree` in the options parameter of the `visitFields` method.

===== Touched not Affected by Value Change Anymore

A form field has a property `touched` which can be set by using `touch()`. A touched form field needs to be saved.
Until now, a value change (by the user or by using `setValue`) set this property to true.
This has been changed so that a value change does not change the property anymore, it can only be modified using `touch()` resp. `markAsSaved()`. This has the benefit that `touched` can be completely controlled by the developer.

In order to check if a value has been changed or a field touched you can use the property `saveNeeded`.

[#busy-handling]
==== Busy handling

The busy handling has been simplified for Scout JS (see xref:releasenotes:release-notes.adoc#busy-handling[Release Notes]).

The `Form.load` and `Form.save` methods now automatically include a busy indicator.
Custom busy indicators for these two operations (e.g. when performing a Rest call) can therefore be removed.

The method `Session.setBusy` was moved to `Desktop.setBusy`. So instead of calling `session.setBusy(...)` use `session.desktop.setBusy(...)`.

=== MenuTypes

The MenuType constants and types were renamed from `MenuTypes` to `MenuType`:

Constants:

* `Calendar.MenuTypes` -> `Calendar.MenuType`
* `ImageField.MenuTypes` -> `ImageField.MenuType`
* `Planner.MenuTypes` -> `Planner.MenuType`
* `TabBox.MenuTypes` -> `TabBox.MenuType`
* `Table.MenuTypes` -> `Table.MenuType`
* `TileGrid.MenuTypes` -> `TileGrid.MenuType`
* `Tree.MenuTypes` -> `Tree.MenuType`
* `ValueField.MenuTypes` -> `ValueField.MenuType`

Types:

* `CalendarMenuTypes` -> `CalendarMenuType`
* `ImageFieldMenuTypes` -> `ImageFieldMenuType`
* `PlannerMenuTypes` -> `PlannerMenuType`
* `TabBoxMenuTypes` -> `TabBoxMenuType`
* `TableMenuTypes` -> `TableMenuType`
* `TileGridMenuTypes` -> `TileGridMenuType`
* `TreeMenuTypes` -> `TreeMenuType`
* `ValueFieldMenuTypes` -> `ValueFieldMenuType`
