Howto:
- Write this document such that it helps people to migrate. Describe what they should do.
- Chronological order is not necessary.
- Choose the right top level chapter (java, js, other)
- Use "WARNING: {NotReleasedWarning}" on its own line to mark parts about not yet released code (also add a "(since <version>)" suffix to the chapter title)
- Use "title case" in chapter titles (https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/14/)

== Utilities

=== DateUtility: New Default Date Time Format

Since this version, the method `DateUtility#formatDateTime` returns the date formatted with the `DateFormat.DEFAULT` and no longer with the `DateFormat.SHORT`.
Now, both methods, `DateUtility#formatDate` and `DateUtility#formatDateTime`, are formatting the date identically.
To apply the old formatting, use `DateUtility#formatDateTimeShort`.

=== New ExceptionUtility

A set of utility methods dealing with `Exception` and `Throwable` were moved and added to the new `ExceptionUtility`.

Change invocations of `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.exception.ExceptionHandler.getRootCause()`
to the new utility method  `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.util.ExceptionUtility.getRootCause()`.

== Adapted REST ErrorDoRestClientExceptionTransformer

The transformation logic for exceptions which occur while invoking a REST client was slightly adapted.
For HTTP error codes 502 (bad gateway), 503 (service unavailable) and 504 (gateway timeout) the adapted `ErrorDoRestClientExceptionTransformer` returns a `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.exception.RemoteSystemUnavailableException` instead of the former generic `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.exception.ProcessingException`.

== Removed Deprecated Code

The following functions were deprecated in a previous release and are now removed completely.

* TabBox.ts: `selectTabById`, replaced by `setSelectedTab`
* JQueryMouseWheelEvent: instead of using `DOMMouseScroll mousewheel` events use `wheel` and JQueryWheelEvent type
* Menu.ts: `addChildActions`, replaced by `insertChildActions`
* Widget.ts: `_isRemovalPending`, replaced by `isRemovalPending`
* CompositeFieldUtility.java: `moveFieldTo`, third parameter removed
* AbstractExtensionChain.java: `callChain`, vararg removed
* AbstractDataModelOperatorField.java: setAttribute, second parameter is not optional anymore
* FocusManager.ts: `requestFocus` does not accept a boolean anymore as third parameter

== Removal of Public Holiday Calendar Support

A few classes used to read public holidays from an XML file and providing them to the calendar were removed without replacement:

** `org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.ui.basic.calendar.provider.AbstractHolidayItemProvider`
** `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.services.common.calendar.IHolidayCalendarService`
** `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.services.common.calendar.HolidayCalendarService`
** `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.services.common.calendar.HolidayItem`
** `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.services.common.calendar.HolidayCalendarItemParser`
