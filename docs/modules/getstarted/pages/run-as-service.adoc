At some point during the application development you will want to install your software on a machine that is intended for productive use.
This is the moment where you need to be able to build and package your Scout application in a way that can be deployed on a server.

A Scout applications can be deployed to any server running Java.
For the purpose of this tutorial we will use https://ubuntu.com/download/server[Ubuntu Server 22.04].

== Prepare directory

The applications will be placed in `/opt/helloscout`.

  mkdir /opt/helloscout

== Prepare Java

Java 17 is required to run the Scout applications

  apt install openjdk-17-jdk

Run

  update-alternatives --config java

and select Java 17 as default.

== Verify the Security Settings

You need to decide if the users of your application should communicate with the Scout frontend server using HTTPS.
We strongly recommend to use HTTPS for any productive environment.
This is why the `Hello Scout` applications are configured to expect HTTPS between the browser and the frontend server for production by default.

In case you don't want to use HTTPS the application must be slightly modified.
Then you can skip the next two sections and instead follow the instructions in section <<run-as-service-work-with-http>>.

== Frontend: Create and Install a Self-Signed Certificate

If you're planing to use a reverse proxy (e.g. https://nginx.org/[nginx]) handling the SSL for your frontend server,
you may skip this section and make sure to use the URL of the reverse proxy instead of the one of the frontend server
when accessing the application in the browser.

The first step is to create a self-signed certificate using the keytool provided with the Java runtime.
The example command line below will create such a certificate using the alias `helloscout_ui_localhost` and place it into the keystore file `helloscout_ui_localhost.jks`

  mkdir /opt/helloscout/certs
  keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -dname CN=localhost -alias helloscout_ui_localhost -keystore /opt/helloscout/certs/helloscout_ui_localhost.jks -keypass changeit_key -storepass changeit_store

The second step is to adapt the configuration of the frontend server to use the newly created certificate

[source]
.helloscout.ui.html.app.zip/config.properties
----
scout.app.port=8443
scout.app.keyStorePassword=changeit_store
scout.app.privateKeyPassword=changeit_key
scout.app.certificateAlias=helloscout_ui_localhost
scout.app.keyStorePath=/opt/helloscout/certs/helloscout_ui_localhost.jks
----

== Frontend-backend server communication over an encrypted channel

The communication between the frontend and the backend server isn't encrypted by default
because they might be running on the same machine or in a protected environment and no access to the backend server is available from "outside".

You might skip this section if encryption of that communication isn't required.

The first two steps are similar to the ones described for the frontend server.

  keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -dname CN=localhost -alias helloscout_server_localhost -keystore /opt/helloscout/certs/helloscout_server_localhost.jks -keypass changeit_key -storepass changeit_store

[source]
.helloscout.server.app.zip/config.properties
----
scout.app.keyStorePassword=changeit_store
scout.app.privateKeyPassword=changeit_key
scout.app.certificateAlias=helloscout_server_localhost
scout.app.keyStorePath=/opt/helloscout/certs/helloscout_server_localhost.jks
----

We don't change the port of the backend server here.
Because the backend server is using HTTPS now, the URL in the frontend server must be modified:

[source]
.helloscout.ui.html.app.zip/config.properties
----
scout.backendUrl=https://localhost:8080
----

Because the frontend server connects over HTTPS, the SSL certificate of the backend server must be trusted by the Java runtime running in the frontend server.

For that, export the newly created self-signed certificate from the `helloscout_server_localhost.jks` keystore file into the `helloscout_server_localhost.der` certificate file.

  keytool -exportcert -alias helloscout_server_localhost -storepass changeit_store -keystore /opt/helloscout/certs/helloscout_server_localhost.jks -file /opt/helloscout/certs/helloscout_server_localhost.der

In the last step add the self-signed certificate to the trusted certificates of the frontend server.

[source]
.helloscout.ui.html.app.zip/config.properties
----
scout.trustedCertificates[0]=/opt/helloscout/certs/helloscout_server_localhost.der
----

As alternative to changing `scout.trustedCertificates`, you could also add the self-signed certificate to the known certificates of the Java runtime (not described here).

Your applications are now properly configured to use an encrypted communication between the frontend und the backend server.

[[run-as-service-work-with-http]]
== Update the Scout Application to work with HTTP

If you prefer to work with HTTP only on the frontend server, you need to modify the security settings of your Scout application.
This can be done with the steps described below.

* In file `config.properties` (in the directory `helloscout.ui.html.app.war/src/main/resources`):
** Add the property `scout.app.sessionCookieConfigSecure=false` to remove the secure flag on the session cookie.
** Add the property `scout.auth.cookieSessionValidateSecure=false` to disable the check for an encrypted channel (HTTPS).

[[run-as-service-create-deployable-unit]]
== Create deployable unit

You are now ready to move the `Hello Scout` application from our development environment to a productive setup.
The simplest option to move our application into the 'wild' is to build it using Maven.

The default output to be used in a productive environment is provided by the `.app.zip` modules.
It will provide two `.zip` archives
The first ZIP file contains the Scout backend server with all business logic.
The second ZIP file contains the Scout frontend server that is responsible for communicating with the web browser of the user.

Each ZIP file contains the following directories:

* bin
** Shell scripts for Unix (`app.sh`) and Windows (`.app.cmd`)
* lib
** All libraries (`*.jar`) required to run the Java application
* conf
** `config.properties` and `logback.xml`

To start the build, use the following command in your parent module (`helloscout`):

  mvn clean verify

This starts the compilation, executes all test cases and bundles the result into two ZIP files.
As soon as the build is reporting success (this may take a few minutes) you can find the built ZIP files:

* The Scout backend ZIP file `helloscout-server.zip` in directory `helloscout/helloscout.server.app.zip/target`
* The Scout frontend ZIP file `helloscout-ui.zip` in directory `helloscout/helloscout.ui.html.app.zip/target`

To see the new files within Eclipse you may need to refresh the `target` directory below each project using the F5 keystroke.

== Unzip & Run

Copy the two ZIP files mentioned above to `/opt/helloscout` and unzip them:

----
cd /opt/helloscout
unzip helloscout-server.zip -d .
unzip helloscout-ui.zip -d .
----

Now start the backend server, then the frontend server

----
cd /opt/helloscout/helloscout-server
bin/app.sh
cd /opt/helloscout/helloscout-ui
bin/app.sh
----

If you've got an exception like

  -bash: bin/app.sh: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory

then the bash scripts are using Windows line separators. Convert them to unix line separators by

----
dos2unix /opt/helloscout/helloscout-server/bin/app.sh
dos2unix /opt/helloscout/helloscout-ui/bin/app.sh
----

Check the logs if both applications started successfully

----
cat /opt/helloscout/helloscout-server/logs/app.plain.log
cat /opt/helloscout/helloscout-ui/logs/app.plain.log
----

You can now connect to the application using the browser of your choice by navigating to:

  http://localhost:8082/

or

  https://localhost:8443/

if you have chosen to configure HTTPS.
In this case you might need to accept your self-signed certificate as the browser does not yet trust it.

Then you will see the login page.
Two users have been predefined: `admin` with password `admin` and `scott` with password `tiger`.
You can find this configuration in the `config.properties` file of the application.

To stop the servers, call

----
kill -15 `cat /opt/helloscout/helloscout-ui/bin/app.pid`
kill -15 `cat /opt/helloscout/helloscout-server/bin/app.pid`
----

== Create a service definition

As the final step of this tutorial, we create two services, one for the frontend, one for the backend server, so that your applications are started automatically.

Stop the servers as mentioned above if not already stopped.

Start by creating a new user

  sudo adduser --system --group --disabled-password --shell /bin/bash --home /home/helloscout --gecos 'Helloscout' helloscout

Make sure that the directory `/opt/helloscout` can be accessed by the user

----
sudo chown -R helloscout:helloscout /opt/helloscout/
sudo chmod -R 750 /opt/helloscout/
----

Now create two service files

[source]
./etc/systemd/system/helloscout-server.service
----
[Unit]
Description=Helloscout Server
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
WorkingDirectory=/opt/helloscout/helloscout-server/
ExecStart=/opt/helloscout/helloscout-server/bin/app.sh
PIDFile=/opt/helloscout/helloscout-server/bin/app.pid

Environment=JAVA_BIN=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/bin/java

User=helloscout
Group=helloscout

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

[source]
./etc/systemd/system/helloscout-ui.service
----
[Unit]
Description=Helloscout UI
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
WorkingDirectory=/opt/helloscout/helloscout-ui/
ExecStart=/opt/helloscout/helloscout-ui/bin/app.sh
PIDFile=/opt/helloscout/helloscout-ui/bin/app.pid

Environment=JAVA_BIN=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/bin/java

User=helloscout
Group=helloscout

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

You're now ready to register the services and start them

----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now helloscout-server
sudo systemctl enable --now helloscout-ui
----

To check the status, call

----
sudo systemctl status helloscout-server
sudo systemctl status helloscout-ui
----

Instead of `status` the keywords: `start`, `stop`, `restart` might be used for the appropriate actions.

NOTE: In a productive environment it is recommended to deploy the server and the user interface into two dedicated machines.
This is because these two tiers have different requirements on resources, load balancing and access protection.
Furthermore, it is strongly recommended using an encrypted connection (e.g. TLS 1.3 footnote:[TLS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security])
between client browsers and the Scout frontend server AND between the Scout frontend and backend server!

== Cleanup

This section is only used to get rid of everything just created.

* Remove the services (and stop them if still running)
* Remove the service definitions
* Remove the directory structure
* Remove the user

----
sudo systemctl disable --now helloscout-server
sudo systemctl disable --now helloscout-ui
rm /etc/systemd/system/helloscout-server.service
rm /etc/systemd/system/helloscout-ui.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
rm -rf /opt/helloscout
deluser helloscout
