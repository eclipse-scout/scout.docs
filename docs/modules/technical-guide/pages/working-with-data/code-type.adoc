= Code Type

include::common:partial$_header.adoc[]

A CodeType is a structure to represent a tree key-code association. They are used in SmartField and SmartColumn.

* implements: `ICodeType<T>`
* extends: `AbstractCodeType<T>`

== Description

CodeTypes are e.g. used in SmartFields, ListBoxes or TreeBoxes to let the user choose between a finite list of values. The value(s) stored by the field correspond to the key(s) of the selected code.

A CodeType can be seen as a tree of Codes. Each code associates to the key (the Id) other properties: among others a Text and an IconId.

In order to have the same resolving mechanism (getting the display text of a key), CodeTypes are also used in SmartColumns.
To choose multiple values in the list, the fields ListBox (flat CodeType) and TreeBox (hierarchical CodeType) can be used.

=== Organisation of the codes

The codes are organized in a tree. Therefore, a CodeType can have one or more child codes at the root level, and each code can have other child codes.
Often a flat list of codes (without nested codes) is sufficient to cover most of the needs.

Child codes are ordered in their parent code. This is implemented using the `@Order` annotation on the code class.

=== Type of the key

The type of the key is defined by its generic parameter `<T>`. It is very common to use a type from the `java.lang.*` package (like `Long` or `String`), but any Java Object is suitable. It must:

* implement `Serializable`
* have correctly implemented `equals()` and `hashCode()` functions
* be present in the server and the client

There is no obligation to have the same type for the Id between the codes of a CodeType (meaning the same generic type parameter for the codes inner-class). However, it is a good practice to have the same type between the codes of a CodeType, because the Id might be used as value of e.g. a SmartField. Therefore, the generic parameter describing the type of value of a SmartField must be compatible with the type of the codes contained in the CodeType.

== Using a CodeType

=== SmartField or SmartColumn

CodeType in a SmartField (or SmartColumn).

[source,java]
----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/codetype/YesOrNoSmartField.java[tags=YesOrNoSmartField]
----

If the SmartField (or SmartColumn) works with a CodeType, a specific LookupCall is instantiated to get the LookupRows based on the Codes contained in a CodeType.

=== Accessing a code directly

Scout-runtime will handle the instantiation and the caching of CodeTypes.

This function returns the text corresponding to the key using a CodeType:

== Static CodeType

=== Java Code and structure

image::common:Scout_CodeType_Structure.png[]

The common way to define a CodeType is to extend AbstractCodeType. Each code is an inner-class extending AbstractCode. Like usual the properties of Codes and CodeTypes can be set by overriding any of the inherited methods starting with `getConfigured`.

See the Java Code of a simple `YesOrNoCodeType` having just two codes:

* `YesOrNoCodeType.YesCode`
* `YesOrNoCodeType.NoCode`

=== Create a new CodeType with the IDE

==== Eclipse

Use File -> New -> Scout -> Scout Code Type to generate a new CodeType.

==== IntelliJ

Use the context menu on a package and select New -> Scout Element -> Code Type to generate a new CodeType.

== Dynamic CodeType

Code types are not necessarily hardcoded. It is possible to implement other mechanisms to load a CodeType dynamically.

The description of the Codes can e.g. come from a database or any other data source. If you want to do so, you just need to implement the method corresponding to the event `LoadCodes`.

It is possible to use the static and the dynamic approach together. In this case, if there is a conflict (2 codes for the same id) the event OverwriteCode is triggered.

Note for advanced users:

Each CodeType is instantiated for

* each language
* each partition

Note: A CodeType class is instantiated for each Locale and managed by the `CodeService`.
