//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file describes the architecture of the Scout Platform
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scout contains a platform which provides basic functionality required by many software applications. The following list gives some examples for which tasks the platform is responsible for:

* <<sec-app.lifecycle,Application Lifecycle Management>>
* <<sec-bean.manager,Object Instance Management (Bean Management)>>
* <<sec-config.management,Configuration Management>>
* <<sec-class.inventory,Application Inventory>>

[[sec-app.lifecycle]]
== Application Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a Scout application is controlled by implementations of `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.IPlatform`.
This interface contains methods to start and stop the application and to retrieve the <<sec-bean.manager,Bean Manager>> associated with this application.
The class `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.Platform` provides access to the current platform instance. On first access the platform is automatically created and started.

image::common:platformStates.png[]

During its startup, the platform transitions through several states. Depending on the state of the platform some components may already be initialized and ready to use while others are not available yet.

See enum `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.IPlatform.State` for a description of each state and what may be used in a certain state.

=== Platform Listener

To participate in the application startup or shutdown a platform listener can be created.
For this a class implementing `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.IPlatformListener` must be created. The listener is automatically a bean and must therefore not be registered anywhere.
See <<sec-bean.manager>> to learn more about bean management in Scout and how the listener becomes a bean.
As soon as the state of the platform changes the listener will be notified.

[source,java,indent=0]
.A listener that will do some work as soon as the platform has been started.
----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/PlatformSnippet.java[tags=PlatformListener]
----

TIP: As platform listeners may run as part of the startup or shutdown not the full Scout platform may be available. Depending on the state some tasks cannot be performed or some platform models are not available yet!

[[sec-class.inventory]]
== Class Inventory

Scout applications use an inventory containing the classes available together with some meta data about them.
This allows finding classes available on the classpath by certain criteria:

* All subclasses of a certain base class (also known as type hierarchy)
* All classes having a specific annotation.

This class inventory can be accessed as described in listing <<lst-ClassInventory>>.

[[lst-ClassInventory]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.Access the Scout class inventory.
----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/PlatformSnippet.java[tags=ClassInventory]
----

=== scout.xml

In its static initializer, the `ClassInventory` collects classes in projects containing a resource called META-INF/scout.xml.

Scanning all classes would be unnecessarily slow and consume too much memory.
The file `scout.xml` is just an empty xml file. Scout itself also includes `scout.xml` files in all its projects.

The format XML was chosen to allow adding exclusions in large projects, but this feature is not implemented right now.

TIP: It is recommended to add an emtpy `scout.xml` file into the META-INF folder of your projects, such that the classes are available in the 'ClassInventory'.

Scout uses Jandex footnote:[
https://github.com/smallrye/jandex
] to build the class inventory. The meta data to find classes can be pre-computed during build time into an index file describing the contents of the jar file. See the jandex project for details.

[[sec-bean.manager]]
== Bean Manager

The Scout bean manager is a dynamic registry for beans. Beans are normal Java classes usually having some meta data describing the characteristics of the class.

The bean manager can be changed at any time. This means beans can be registered or unregistered while the application is running. For this the bean manager contains methods to register and unregister beans. Furthermore, methods to retrieve beans are provided.

The next sections describe how beans are registered, the different meta data of beans, how instances are created, how they can be retrieved and finally how the bean decoration works.

=== Bean registration

Usually beans are registered during application startup. The application startup can be intercepted using platform listeners as described in <<Platform Listener>>.

[[lst-RegisterBeansListener]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.A listener that registers a bean (direct class or with meta data).
----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/PlatformSnippet.java[tags=RegisterBeansListener]
----

There is also a predefined bean registration built into the Scout runtime. This automatically registers all classes having an `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.@Bean` annotation. Therefore, it is usually sufficient to only annotate a class with `@Bean` to have it available in the bean manager as shown in listing <<lst-NormalBeanClass>>.

[[lst-NormalBeanClass]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.A normal bean
----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/PlatformSnippet.java[tags=BeanClass]
----

TIP: As the `@Bean` annotation is an `java.lang.annotation.@Inherited` annotation, this automatically registers all child classes too. This means that also interfaces may be `@Bean` annotated making all implementations automatically available in the bean manager! Furthermore, other annotations may be `@Bean` annotated making all classes holding these annotations automatically to beans as well.

TIP: If you inherit a `@Bean` annotation from one of you super types but don't want to be automatically registered into the bean manger you can use the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.@IgnoreBean` annotation. Those classes will then be skipped.

==== @TunnelToServer

There is a built-in annotation `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.@TunnelToServer`. Interfaces marked with this annotation are called on the server. The server itself ignores this annotation.

To achieve this a bean is registered on client side for each of those interfaces. Because the platform cannot directly create an instance for these beans a specific producer is registered which creates a proxy that delegates the call to the server.
Please note that this annotation is not inherited. Therefore, if an interface extends a tunnel-to-server interface and the new methods of this interface should be called on the server as well the new child interface has to repeat the annotation!

The proxy is created only once for a specific interface bean.

=== Bean Scopes

The most important meta data of a bean is the scope. It describes how many instances of a bean can exist in a single application. There are two different possibilities:

* Unlimited instances: Each bean retrieval results in a new instance of the bean. This is the default.
* Only one instance: There can only be one instance by Scout platform. From an application point of view this can be seen as singleton. The instance is created on first use and each subsequent retrieval of the bean results in this same cached instance.

As like all bean meta data this characteristic can be provided in two different ways:

. With a Java annotation on the bean class as shown in the listing <<lst-BeanClass>>.
. With bean meta data as shown in listing <<lst-RegisterBeansListener>>.

[[lst-BeanClass]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.An application scoped bean using annotations
----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/PlatformSnippet.java[tags=BeanSingletonClass]
----

So the Java annotation `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.@ApplicationScoped` describes a bean having singleton characteristics.

TIP: Also `@ApplicationScoped` is an `@Inherited` annotation. Therefore, all child classes automatically inherit this characteristic like with the `@Bean` annotation.

=== Bean Creation

It is not only possible to influence the number of instances to be created (see <<Bean Scopes>>), but also to create beans eagerly, execute methods after creation (like constructors) or to delegate the bean creation completely. These topics are described in the next sections.

==== Eager Beans

By default beans are created on each request. An exception are the beans marked to be application scoped (as shown in <<Bean Scopes>>). Those beans are only created on first request (lazy). This means if a bean is never requested while the application is running, there will never be an instance of this class.

But sometimes it is necessary to create beans already at the application startup (eager). This can be done by marking the bean as `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.@CreateImmediately`. All classes holding this annotation must also be marked as `@ApplicationScoped`! These beans will then be created as part of the application startup.

==== Constructors

Beans must have empty constructors so that the bean manager can create instances. But furthermore it is possible to mark methods with the `jakarta.annotation.@PostConstruct` annotation. Those methods must have no parameters and will be called after instances have been created.

TIP: When querying the bean manager for an application scoped bean, it will always return the same instance. However, the constructor of an application scoped bean may run more than once, whereas a method annotated with @PostConstruct in an application scoped been is guaranteed to run exactly once.

=== Bean Retrieval

To retrieve a bean the class `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.BEANS` should be used. This class provides (amongst others) the following methods:

[[lst-BeanRetrieval]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.How to get beans.
----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/PlatformSnippet.java[tags=BeanRetrieval]
----

* The `get()` method throws an exception if there is not a single bean result. So if no bean can be found or if multiple equivalent bean candidates are available this method fails!
* The `opt()` method requires a single or no bean result. It fails if multiple equivalent bean candidates are available and returns `null` if no one can be found.
* The `all()` method returns all beans in the correct order. The list may also contain no beans at all.

There are now two more annotations that have an effect on which beans are returned if multiple beans match a certain class. Consider the following example bean hierarchy:

[[img-beanHierarchy]]
.A sample bean hierarchy.
image::common:beanHierarchy.png[]

In this situation 4 bean candidates are available: MyServiceImpl, MyServiceMod, MySpecialVersion and AnotherVersion.
But which one is returned by `BEANS.get(IMyService.class)`? Or by `BEANS.get(MySpecialVersion.class)`?
This can be influenced with the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.@Order` and `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.@Replace` annotations.
The next sections describe the idea behind these annotations and gives some examples.

==== @Order

This annotation works exactly the same as in the Scout user interface where it brings classes into an order. It allows to assign a `double` value to a class. All beans of a certain type are sorted according to this value in ascending order. This means a low order value is equivalent with a low position in a list (come first).

Please note that the `@Order` annotation is not inherited so that each bean must declare its own value where it fits in.

TIP: The `@Order` annotation value may be inherited in case it replaces. See the next section for details.

If a bean does not declare an order value, the default of `5000` is used. Scout itself uses orders from `4001` to `5999`.
So for user applications the value `4000` and below can be used to declare more important beans.
For testing bean mocks the value `-10'000` can be used which then usually comes before each normal Scout or application bean.

image::common:defaultOrders.png[]

==== @Replace

The `@Replace` annotation can be set to beans having another bean as super class. This means that the original bean (the super class) is no longer available in the Scout bean manager and only the new child class is returned.

If the replacing bean (the child class) has no own `@Order` annotation defined but the replaced bean (the super class) has an `@Order` value, this order is inherited to the child. This is the only special case in which the `@Order` annotation value is inherited!

=== Examples

The next examples use the bean situation as shown in figure <<img-beanHierarchy>>.
In this situation the bean manager actually contains 3 beans:

. `AnotherVersion` with `@Order` of 4000. This bean has no own order and would therefore get the default order of 5000. But because it is replacing another bean it inherits its order.
. `MyServiceMod` with `@Order` of 4500. This bean declares its own order.
. `MyServiceImpl` with `@Order` of 5000. This bean gets the default order of 5000 because it does not declare an order.

The bean `MySpecialVersion` is not part of the bean manager because it has been replaced by `AnotherVersion`.

* `BEANS.get(IMyService.class)`: Returns `AnotherVersion` instance. The result cannot be an exact match because the requested type is an interface. Therefore, of all candidates there is one single candidate with the lowest order (comes first).
* `BEANS.get(MyServiceImpl.class)`: Returns `MyServiceImpl` because there is an exact match available.
* `BEANS.get(MySpecialVersion.class)`: Returns `AnotherVersion`. The result cannot be an exact match because there is no exact bean with this class in the bean manager (`MySpecialVersion` has been replaced). Therefore, only `AnotherVersion` remains as candidate in the hierarchy below `MySpecialVersion`.
* `BEANS.get(MyServiceMod.class)`: Returns `MyServiceMod` because there is no other candidate.
* `BEANS.all(IMyService.class)`: Returns a list with all beans sorted by `@Order`. This results in: `AnotherVersion`, `MyServiceMod`, `MyServiceImpl`.

TIP: If `MyServiceMod` would have no `@Order` annotation, there would be two bean candidates available with the same default order of 5000: `MyServiceImpl` and `MyServiceMod`. In this case a call to `BEANS.get(IMyService.class)` would fail because there are several equivalent candidates. Equivalent candidates means they have the same `@Order` value and the system cannot decide which one is the right one.

=== Bean Decoration

Bean decorations allow to wrap interfaces with a proxy to intercept each method call to the interface of a bean and apply some custom logic.
For this a `IBeanDecorationFactory` has to be implemented. This is one single factory instance for the entire application. It decides which decorators are created for a bean request.
The factory is asked for decorators on every bean retrieval. This allows to write bean decoration factories depending on dynamic conditions.

As bean decoration factories are beans themselves, it is sufficient to create an implementation of `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.IBeanDecorationFactory` and to ensure this implementation is used (see <<Bean Retrieval>>).
This factory receives the bean to be decorated and the originally requested bean class to decide which decorators it should create.
In case no decoration is required the factory may return `null`. Then the original bean is used without decorations.

TIP: Decorations are only supported if the class obtained by the bean manager (e.g. by using `BEANS.get()`) is an interface!

TIP: It is best practice to mark all annotations that are interpreted in the bean decoration factory with the annotation `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.@BeanInvocationHint`. However, this annotation has no effect at runtime and is only for documentation reasons.

The sample in listing <<lst-BeanDecorationFactory>> wraps each call to the server with a profiler decorator that measures how long a server call takes.

[[lst-BeanDecorationFactory]]

.Bean decoration example.
----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/PlatformSnippet.java[tags=BeanDecorationFactory]
----

=== Destroy Beans

Application scoped beans can declare methods annotated with `jakarta.annotation.@PreDestroy`. These methods will be called when the Scout platform is stopping.
The methods may have any visibility modifier but must not be static and must not declare any parameters.
If such a pre-destroy method throws an exception, the platform will continue to call all other pre-destroy methods (even methods on the same bean).

Please note that pre-destroy methods are only called for application-scoped beans that already have created their instance.

Pre-destroy methods inherited from super classes are always called after the ones from the class itself. Methods that are overridden are only called on the leaf class.
Private methods are always called (because they cannot be overridden). The order in which multiple methods in the same declaring class are called is undefined.

[[sec-config.management]]
== Configuration Management

Applications usually require some kind of configuration mechanism to use the same binaries in a different environment or situation. Scout applications provide a configuration mechanism using properties files footnote:[
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties
].

For each property a class cares about default values and value validation. These classes share the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.IConfigProperty` interface and are normal application scoped beans providing access to a specific configuration value as shown in listing <<lst-ConfigProperties>>. If the property class is an inner class it has to be defined as a static class with the `static` modifier.

[[lst-ConfigProperties]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.A configuration property of type Long.
----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/test/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/platform/config/MyCustomTimeoutProperty.java[tags=ConfigProperties]
----
<1> key
<2> default value

To read the configured value you can use the `CONFIG` class as demonstrated in <<lst-getPropertyValue>>.

[[lst-getPropertyValue]]
[source,java,indent=0]
.Read the configured value in your code.
----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/test/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/platform/config/ScoutConfigTest.java[tags=getPropertyValue]
----

=== Property resolution

The given property key is searched in the following environments:

. In the system properties (`java.lang.System.getProperty(String)`).
. In the environment variables of the system (`java.lang.System.getenv(String)`).
. In the properties file. The properties file can be
.. a file on the local filesystem where the system property with key `config.properties` holds an absolute URL to the file or
.. a file on the classpath with path `/config.properties` (recommended).
. If none of the above is found, the default value of the property is applied.

Supported formats are simple key-value pairs, list values and map values. For more details about the format please refer to the JavaDoc of the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.PropertiesHelper` class.

Since the environment variable names are more restrictive in many shells and systems than the property names in Java, overriding a property containing a dot/period (`.`) with an environment variable would not be possible.
To still allow overriding of such properties, the following lookup rules are applied in-order to find a matching environment variable:

. An exact match of your property key (`my.property`)
. A match where periods are replaced by underscores (`my_property`)
. An uppercase match of your property key (`MY.PROPERTY`)
. An uppercase match where periods are replaced by underscores (`MY_PROPERTY`)

When it comes to working with String list or map value config properties (subclasses of `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.AbstractMapConfigProperty` or `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.AbstractStringListConfigProperty`), there's also some special mechanic to consider in terms of providing or overriding property list or map values using environment variables.
Since it is not possible to reliably retrieve the original list/map key from an environment variable (again, due to the restrictions mentioned above), property map values may be supplied as a JSON object string:

[source]
----
my_map_property={"map-key-01": "value-01", "map-key-02": "value-02", "map-key-03": null}
my_list_property={"0": "value-01", "1": "value-02", "2": null}
----

The usage of a JSON object string for a map/list property is not restricted to only environment variables but can be used within system properties or a properties file too.

The following rules apply, when such properties are read:

* property map key/value pairs are added from the JSON object to the property map, overriding keys already being defined by sources of lower precedence (e.g. config.properties file)
* a JSON object attribute value of "null" will remove a key potentially being defined by sources of lower precedence
* a property value given by the [] pattern will override the value given by a JSON object string defined by the same source. Example within the same source (e.g. config.properties file):
** `my.map.property={"map-key-01": "value-01", "map-key-02": "value-02"}`
** `my.map.property[map-key-02]=overridden-value-02`
** Results in the value `overridden-value-02 for `map-key-02`

The parsing of JSON object strings is abstracted away using the new `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.IJsonPropertyReader` interface as parsing JSON strings is not implemented in the platform itself.
However, there is a default implementation of this interface available in org.eclipse.scout.rt.dataobject which uses the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.dataobject.IDataObjectMapper` feature to deserialize the JSON string into a Java Map.
In order to use this, an implementation of the `IDataObjectMapper` interface is also required (e.g. `org.eclipse.scout.rt.jackson.dataobject.JacksonDataObjectMapper`).
So in case you want to use this feature, you have to define

* org.eclipse.scout.rt:org.eclipse.scout.rt.dataobject
* org.eclipse.scout.rt:org.eclipse.scout.rt.jackson

as new dependencies of your application aggregator module (if they are not already present).


A properties file may import other config files from the classpath or any other absolute URL. This is done using the special key `import`. It can be a single value or a list or map (e.g. `import[anyKey or number]`:

* `import[0]=classpath:myConfigs/other.properties`
* `import[1]=file:/C:/path/to/my/settings.properties`
* `import[2]=file:${catalina.base}/conf/db_connection.properties`

Scout already has some config properties. For a list and the corresponding documentation see <<sec-app.configProperties>>.


=== Additional examples

Because the property classes are managed by the bean manager, you can use all the mechanisms to change the behavior (`@Replace` in particular).

<<lst-PropertyConstant>> demonstrates how you can use the @Replace annotation to change the existing `ApplicationNameProperty` class.
The value is no longer fetched via the config mechanism, because the `getValue(String)` method is overridden.
In this case a fixed value is returned.

The next example presented in <<lst-PropertyRedirection>> uses the same idea.
In this case, the `getKey()` method is overridden to read the value from another key as demonstrated is the <<lst-PropertyRedirectionConfig>>.

----

=== Configuration validation

During the Platform startup all classes implementing the interface `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.IConfigurationValidator` are asked to validate configuration provided in the `config.properties` files.
If there is at least one `IConfigurationValidator` that accepts a given key-value-pair the configuration is considered to be valid. Otherwise, the platform will not start.

The concrete implementation `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.ConfigPropertyValidator` will also check if a configured value matches the default value. In case it does an info message (warn in development mode) will be logged but the platform will still start.
To minimize configuration files such entries should be removed from `config.properties` files.
