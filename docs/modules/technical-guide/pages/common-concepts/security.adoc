== Default HTTP Response Headers

All Scout HTTP servlets delegate to a central authority to append HTTP response headers. This is the bean `HttpServletControl`.
It enables developers to control which headers that should be added to the HTTP response for each servlet and request.

The next sections describe the headers that are added to any response by default. Beside these also the following headers may be of interest for an end user application (consider adding them to your application if possible):

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Public_Key_Pinning[Public Key Pinning]
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797[Strict Transport Security (HSTS)]
* https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg622941%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396[X-Content-Type-Options]

NOTE: Please note that not all headers are supported in all user agents!

=== X-Frame-Options

The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header footnote:[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/X-Frame-Options] can be used to indicate whether a user agent should be allowed to render a page in a `<frame>`, `<iframe>` or `<object>`.
Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking] attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.
The X-Frame-Options header is described in RFC 7034 footnote:[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034].

In Scout this header is set to `SAMEORIGIN` which allows the page to be displayed in a frame on the same origin (scheme, host and port) as the page itself only.

=== X-XSS-Protection

This header is no longer interpreted by modern browser engines and is considered insecure.
Scout does no longer set this header in `HttpServletControl`.

See MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection

=== Content Security Policy

Content Security Policy is an HTTP response header that helps you reduce XSS  risks on modern user agents by declaring what dynamic resources are allowed to load footnote:[http://content-security-policy.com/].
The CSP header is described in http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP1/[Level 1] and http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/[Level 2]. There is also a working draft for a http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/[Level 3].

Scout makes use of Level 1 (and one directive from Level 2) and sets by default the following settings:

* JavaScript footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript]: Only accepts JavaScript resources from the same origin (same scheme, host and port). Inline JavaScript is allowed and unsafe dynamic code evaluation (like `eval(string)`, `setTimeout(string)`, `setInterval(string)`, `new Function(string)`) is allowed as well.
* Stylesheets (CSS) footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets]: Only accepts Stylesheet resources from the same origin (same scheme, host and port). Inline style attributes are allowed.
* Frames footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(World_Wide_Web)]: All sources are allowed because the iframes created by the Scout BrowserField run in the sandbox mode and therefore handle the security policy on their own.
* All other types (Image, `WebSocket` footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket], `EventSource` footnote:[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource], AJAX calls footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29], fonts, `<object>` footnote:[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object], `<embed>` footnote:[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/embed], `<applet>` footnote:[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/applet], `<audio>` footnote:[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio] and `<video>` footnote:[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video]) only allow resources from the same origin (same scheme, host and port).

If a resource is blocked because it violates the CSP a report is created and logged on server side using level `warning`. This is done in the class `ContentSecurityPolicyReportHandler`.
This enables admins to monitor the application and to react if a CSP violation is detected.

== Session Cookie (JSESSIONID Cookie) Configuration Validation
The UiServlet checks if the session cookie is configured safely. The validation is only performed on first access to the `UiServlet`. There is no automatic validation on the backend server side or on any custom servlets!

If the validation fails, a corresponding error message is logged to the server and an exception is thrown making the `UiServlet` inaccessible. Because of security reasons the exception shown to the user includes no details about the error. These can only be seen on the server side log.

=== HttpOnly
First the existence of the `HttpOnly` flag is checked. The servlet container will then add this flag to the `Set-Cookie` HTTP response header. If the user agent supports this flag, the cookie cannot be accessed through a client side script. As a result even if a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw exists and a user accidentally accesses a link that exploits this flaw, the user agent will not reveal the cookie to a third party.
For a list of user agents supporting this feature please refer to https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTPOnly#Browsers_Supporting_HttpOnly[OWASP].

This flag is enabled by default via `scout.app.sessionCookieConfigHttpOnly`.

=== Secure
Second the existence of the `Secure` flag is checked. The servlet container will then add this flag to the `Set-Cookie` HTTP response header. The purpose of the secure flag is to prevent cookies from being observed by unauthorized parties due to the transmission of a cookie in clear text. Therefore, setting this flag will prevent the user agent from transmitting the session id over an unencrypted channel.

This flag is enabled by default for non-development builds via `scout.app.sessionCookieConfigSecure`.

This of course only makes sense if the application is exposed to the end user using an encrypted channel like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS[HTTPS] (which is strongly recommended).

== Secure Output
This chapter describes how HTML Output can be handled in a secure way.

Scout applications often display potentially dangerous data, e.g. user input or data from other systems.
Encoding this input in such a way, that it can not be executed, prevents security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting.

=== Encoding by Default

By default, all input in the Scout model is encoded. Examples are values/labels in value fields, cells in tables, message in message box.
The reason behind this default choice is that developers do not have to think about output encoding in the standard case
and are therefore less likely to forget output encoding and introduce a security vulnerability.

Example: In the following label field, the HTML <b> tag is encoded as `\&lt;b\&gt;bold text\&lt;/b\&gt;`:

image::common:encodedField.png[]

include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/LabelFieldEncodingForm.java[tags=SecureOutput.encodingByDefault]

=== Html Enabled

Sometimes developers may want to use HTML in the Scout model.

Examples are

* Simple styling of dynamic content, such as addresses or texts in message boxes
* Text containing application-internal or external links
* Html or XML content received from other systems, such as e-mails or html pages

Html input should only partially be encoded or not at all.

To disable the encoding of the whole value, the property `HtmlEnabled` can be used:

include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/LabelFieldEncodingForm.java[tags=SecureOutput.noEncodingField]

There are several ways to implement the use cases above. Some typical implementations are described in the following sections.

==== CSS Class and Other Model Properties

Often using HTML in value fields or table cells is not necessary for styling. Very basic styling can be done for example by setting the CSS class.

==== HTML Builder

For creating simple HTML files or fragments with encoded user input, the class `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.html.HTML` can be used. It is also easily possible to create application internal and external link with this approach.

==== Styling in the UI-Layer

For more complex HTML, using `IBeanField` in the scout model and implementing the styling in the UI-Layer is often the preferred way.
Links are possible as well.

==== Manual Encoding

It is also possible to encode any String manually using `StringUtility.htmlEncode(String)`. `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.html.HTML` uses this method internally for encoding.
However, using `HTML` is recommended, where possible, because it is more concise and leads to less errors.

==== Using a White-List Filter

If HTML or XML from external sources or more complex HTML are used in the Scout model, using a white-list filter might be the best way to avoid security bugs.
Libraries, such as http://jsoup.org/[JSoup] provide such a white-list filter. Scout currently does not include any services or utilities for using white-list filters,
because the configuration and usage is very use-case-specific and would therefore not add much benefit.

[#authorization-granting]
== Authorization (Granting)

Scout uses the `java.security` API principles to grant access to a specific resource.

Each user has a set of granted `java.security.Permission` instances.
This set is a `java.security.PermissionCollection`.
A call to `PermissionCollection.implies(Permission p)` does the access check.
The argument `p` in this call is a new permission instance for which we want to do the access check and which is compared against the granted permissions.
Usually, the permission collection implementation iterates through all granted permissions and calls on each `Permission.implies(Permission p)` until one call returns `true`.

Scout adds some concepts and helpers to this API:

`IPermission`:: Unlike other permissions, a permission implementing this interface can only be implied by another `IPermission` *with the same name*.
A permission used together with scouts security API does not have to implement the `IPermission` interface, but it is recommended.
`PermissionLevel`:: An `IPermission`, which is part of an `IPermissionCollection` has always a granted access level assigned (`IPermission.getLevel()`).
If the granted level is `PermissionLevel.NONE`, any access checks will fail.
`IAccessControlService`:: This service is responsible to provide and manage a users set of granted permissions.
A scout application usually extends `AbstractAccessControlService` and implements `#execLoadPermissions`.
`ACCESS`:: Provides a set of convenience methods to check access.

Let us assume you require a permission to allow a user to access companies.

To check access one can use `ACCESS`.

----
<1> Checks permission against granted permissions of current user.
<2> Checks permission and if this check fails, throw an `AccessForbiddenException` with a default message.

We can define a default access check failed message for a permission.

`ACCESS` allows to check multiple permissions at once.

----

We have seen some simple permission checks.
Now let us assume, that some users may modify a company only if they have registered the company by themselves.
For this use case we introduce a new permission level `ScoutdocPermissionLevels.OWN`.
This is the permission level which is granted for those users.

[source,java]
----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/ScoutdocPermissionLevels.java[tags=ScoutdocPermissionLevels]
----

In order to check access for this new level we have to override `AbstractPermission#evalPermission`.

----
include::common:example$org.eclipse.scout.docs.snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/docs/snippets/AccessSnippet.java[tags=ACCESS_C]
----

If such a service call would be expensive, one may cache the result of such a permission check.
You have to implement this by yourself.
A recommended solution is to create a wrapper around `IPermissionCollection` and this wrapper caches calls to `IPermissionCollection#implies` if required.

[#scoutjs]
=== Scout JS

The `access` utility provides the possibility and convenience of checking permissions in Scout JS code.

All necessary information the Scout JS code needs is made available by the `PermissionResource` in the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.api`-module.
To enable the feature this REST resource needs to be added to the server and the `access` utility needs to be bootstrapped in the entry file.

.Add maven dependency to server providing REST resources (see xref:technical-guide:working-with-data/rest.adoc[])
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.scout.rt</groupId>
  <artifactId>org.eclipse.scout.rt.api</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

.bootstrap the `access` utility in the entry file `myapp.js`
[source,javascript]
----
new App().init({
  bootstrap: {
    permissionsUrl: 'api/permissions'
  }
});
----

If the visibility of a field depends on a permission the `access` utility can be used to evaluate this permission.
The method `quickCheck` returns a `boolean` while `check` returns a `JQuery.Promise<boolean>`

[source,ts]
----
field.setVisible(access.quickCheck('SomePermission'));

access.check('SomePermission').then(granted => field.setVisible(granted);
----

If one has created ``IOwnPermission``s with a special `implies`-logic and wants to make them available in Scout JS a couple of things need to be added:

* `OwnPermissionDo`, data object used to transfer additional properties from the server to the Scout JS code
* `ToOwnPermissionDoFunction`, `IToDoFunction` transforming `IOwnPermission` into the data object
* `OwnPermission`, Scout JS pendant for `IOwnPermission` used by the `access` utility

.`OwnPermissionDo` containing the `ToOwnPermissionDoFunction`
[source,java]
----
@TypeName("myapp.OwnPermission")
public class OwnPermissionDo extends PermissionDo {

  protected static final String OWN_PERMISSION_OBJECT_TYPE = "myapp.OwnPermission";

  public DoValue<String> foo() {
    return doValue("foo");
  }

  public DoValue<String> bar() {
    return doValue("bar");
  }

  /* **************************************************************************
   * CUSTOM CONVENIENCE TO DO FUNCTION
   * *************************************************************************/

  @Order(4000)
  public static class ToOwnPermissionDoFunction extends AbstractToPermissionDoFunction<IOwnPermission, OwnPermissionDo> {

    @Override
    public void apply(IOwnPermission ownPermission, OwnPermissionDo ownPermissionDo) {
      BEANS.get(ToPermissionDoFunction.class).apply(ownPermission, ownPermissionDo);
      ownPermissionDo
          .withObjectType(OWN_PERMISSION_OBJECT_TYPE) // important to create the correct Scout JS pendant
          .withFoo(ownPermission.getFoo())
          .withBar(ownPermission.getBar());
    }
  }

  /* **************************************************************************
   * GENERATED CONVENIENCE METHODS
   * *************************************************************************/

  // ...
}
----

.important overridden methods in the Scout JS `OwnPermission`
[source,ts]
----
override matches(permission: Permission): boolean {
  if (!super.matches(permission)) {
    return false;
  }
  // check if permission is OwnPermission and foo matches
  if (!(permission instanceof OwnPermission)) {
    return false;
  }
  return this.foo === permission.foo;
}

protected override _evalPermissionQuick(permission: Permission): boolean {
  // check if bar matches
  return super._evalPermissionQuick(permission) && this.bar === permission.bar;
}

protected override _evalPermission(permission: Permission): JQuery.Promise<boolean> {
  // call server to evaluate foo and bar
  return ajax.getJson(`api/permissions/checkFooBar/${permission.foo}/${permission.bar}`)
    .catch((error: AjaxError) => {
      // handle error and return false
      return false;
    });
}
----

The `PermissionResource` will automatically collect the granted ``IOwnPermission``s of a user (see xref:authorization-granting[Authorization (Granting)]).
These ``IOwnPermission``s will be transformed by the `ToOwnPermissionDoFunction` and send to the browser where `OwnPermission` instances are created.
Each access check will now automatically consider the `matches`-, `implies`- and `evaluate`-logic of `OwnPermission`.

== Login Form

Scout provides support for form based login.
To activate the form based login, a `login.html` needs to be provided and the `FormBasedAccessController` along with a `ICredentialVerifier` needs to be added to the `AuthFilter`.
An example setup can be found in the archetype.

[[two-factor-auth]]
=== Two-factor Authentication (2FA)

The form based login also supports two-factor-authentication.

If the registered `ICredentialVerifier` requests a second factor by returning `AUTH_2FA_REQUIRED`, the `FormBasedAccessController` instructs the UI to show an input field so the user can enter the token.
To verify this token a second-factor verifier `ICredentialVerifier` needs to be registered.

[[iid-signature]]
== IId signature

Scout provides a mechanism to add signatures to instances of `IId` when they are serialized into a string value.
This feature was added to prevent key probing of sequential generated ids to sensitive transactional data.
To use this feature simply pass the `IdCodecFlag.SIGNATURE` to the `IdCodec` while serializing or deserializing the id.

.serialize an `IId` using signatures
[source,java]
----
BEANS.get(IdCodec.class).toQualified(id, IdCodecFlag.SIGNATURE)
----

The default implementation will use the unqualified part of the serialized id and create a signature which is added as a suffix.
The validity of this signature is checked again when the id is deserialized.

.deserialize a `String` using signatures
[source,java]
----
BEANS.get(IdCodec.class).fromQualified(idString, IdCodecFlag.SIGNATURE)
----

To use this feature one needs to set the config property `scout.idSignaturePassword` which is used to create the signature.

The signature can easily be extended by replacing the `IdCodec` and overriding the `createSignature` method. One can e.g. additionally use the current user id for the signature.
Also, the whole mechanism can be changed by overriding `addSignature` and `removeSignature`.

If an `IId` needs to be signed or not, depends on why it is serialized and the type of the id itself.
Does the `IId` need to be persisted into a database it is usually unsigned as it can't be read again if the creation of the signature changes.
But if the `IId` is sent to the browser or another application it typically needs to be signed. All data sent to the browser is serialized in the JSON layer and this serialization will always use signatures.
If an application provides e.g. REST endpoints two things need to be done to ensure signature creation.

[#add-dependency-server]
1. A dependency to the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest.jersey.server` module needs to be added to the app module of the application.
[#add-header-server]
2. The header `X-ScoutIdSignature` need to be added to all requests.

The dependency added in xref:add-dependency-server[1.] will add the `IdSignatureRestContainerFilter` which turns on the signature creation for all requests containing the header `X-ScoutIdSignature`.

.dependency to the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest.jersey.server` module
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.scout.rt</groupId>
  <artifactId>org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest.jersey.server</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The header in xref:add-header-server[2.] can be added in multiple ways. It can be added e.g. by a client like the browser directly or added by the server to all requests.
Let's say the application provides REST endpoints under `/api` the `IdSignatureFilter` can be used to add the header to all requests to this path.

[source,java]
.Registration example for `IdSignatureFilter`.
----
public static class ApiIdSignatureFilterContributor implements IServletFilterContributor {

  @Override
  public void contribute(ServletContextHandler handler) {
    handler.addFilter(IdSignatureFilter.class, "/api/*", null);
  }
}
----

IMPORTANT: A signed `IId` may contain special characters such as `#` or `;`.
When such an `IId` is used as an URL parameter it needs to be encoded (see https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.html#section-2[RFC 3986]).
This encoding needs to be done in the application, you can use e.g. `encodeURIComponent()` in JS or `IOUtility.urlEncode()` in Java.
In addition, make sure that no part of your infrastructure setup (e.g. a proxy) decodes these URL encoded parameters before the request reaches your Scout server as this will lead to unexpected behaviour.
If you are using e.g. an Apache reverse proxy (see https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html[Apache documentation]) consider enabling the `nocanon` flag as this particular proxy will decode all URLs by default.

Also requests sent by a REST client can be signed automatically. To achieve this, two things need to be done.

[#add-dependency-client]
1. A dependency to the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest.jersey.client` module needs to be added to the app module of the application.
[#add-header-client]
2. The header `X-ScoutIdSignature` need to be added to all request.

The dependency added in xref:add-dependency-client[1.] will add the `IdSignatureRestClientFilter` which turns on the signature creation for all requests containing the header `X-ScoutIdSignature`.

.dependency to the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest.jersey.client` module

  <artifactId>org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest.jersey.client</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

`IId` that are not affected by key probing like e.g. `AbstractUuId` or `AbstractStringId` will not be signed by default, while e.g. all `Long` based `IId` will be signed.
If there is a special `IId` that does not support signatures it can be excluded from the signature mechanism using the `IdSignature` annotation.

[source,java]
.Exclude the `UnsignedId` using the `IdSignature` annotation.
----
@IdSignature(false)
public final class UnsignedId extends AbstractStringId {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  private UnsignedId(String id) {
    super(id);
  }
}
