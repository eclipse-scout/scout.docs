A form field is a special kind of widget.
It is mainly used on forms but may actually be added to any other widget.

Every form field consists of the following parts:

This illustrates nicely some of the main features of a form field:

. It can have a label +
  The label describes the purpose of the field.
  It can be on the left side, on top or even in the field itself.
. It can be mandatory +
  A mandatory field needs to be filled in when the form is saved.
. It can have a status +
  The status can be a tooltip with more details about the field.
  It may also show an error status if the field has invalid input.
  Or it can show a menu if the field provides actions.

Typical form fields are `StringField`, `DateField` or `TableField`.
All these fields have the API of `FormField` in common (like `setLabel()`, `setErrorStatus()`, etc.) but also provide additional API.

Some form fields are actually just a wrapper for another widget.
This is for example the case for the `TableField`.
The `Table` itself may be used stand-alone, just call `scout.create(Table, {})`.
But if you want to use it in a `GroupBox`, which is a form field, you have to use a `TableField` wrapping the `Table`.
