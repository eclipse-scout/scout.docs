= Logical Grid
include::common:partial$_header.adoc[]

The `logical grid layout` arranges the elements in an (invisible) grid, so they are nicely aligned.
The grid consists of rows and columns and every element is put into a grid cell.
The width, height and gaps of the rows and columns are predefined, but could be adjusted if necessary (using `LogicalGridLayoutConfig`).

The position, size and behavior of a grid cell is defined by the `grid data` of an element.
This grid data object is computed automatically by the `logical grid` based on the order of the elements and the `grid data hints`.
So, to control how the fields should be arranged, you need to adjust the `grid data hints` and make sure the elements have the correct order.

== Grid Data Hints
With the grid data hints you can define the dimensions of a grid cell:

* `x` / `y` +
The position inside the grid. If set to -1, it will be calculated automatically by the logical grid based on the order of the fields. Using -1 (which is the default) is the preferred way, so in most cases you should not set the position explicitly.
* `w` / `h` +
The logical size of the grid cell. E.g. if the grid has two columns, setting w to 2 will make the field span both columns.
It is also used as min size if the grid cell should scale, see `weightX` / `weightY`.
* `weightX` / `weightY` +
Configures how much a grid cell should grow or shrink. +
The value for this property can either be -1 or between 0 and 1.
** 0 means fixed size and the grid cell won't grow or shrink.
** Greater 0 means the grid cell will grab the excess space and therefore grow or shrink. If the container
contains more than one element with `weightX` resp. `weightY` > 0, the weight is used to specify how strong the size of the grid cell should be adjusted.
** -1 means the ui computes the optimal value so that the elements proportionally grab the excess space. +
* `useUiWidth` / `useUiHeight` +
Configures whether the element should be as big as preferred by the UI.
If the element has children, the preferred size normally is the computed size of the children. +
This property typically has less priority than `widthInPixel` resp. `heightInPixel` and therefore only has an effect if no explicit size in pixel is set.
* `horizontalAlignment` / `verticalAlignment` +
Configures the alignment of the element inside a grid cell, if `fillHorizontal` resp. `fillVertical` is set to false.
* `fillHorizontal` / `fillVertical` +
Configures whether the element should fill the grid cell.
** If the property is set to true, the element takes all the space and therefore is as big as the grid cell.
** If it's set to false, the size is computed based on the properties `useUiWidth` resp. `useUiHeight` and `widthInPixel` resp. `heightInPixel`.
** If non of these are set, a default value is used which typically is the size of a logical grid column resp. logical grid row.
* `widthInPixel` / `heightInPixel` +
Configures the preferred size of the element in pixel.
If the value is less than or equal to 0 the property has no effect.
* `maxWidthInPixel` / `maxHeightInPixel` +
Configures the maximum size of the element in pixel.
If the value is less than or equal to 0 there is no maximum.

=== Example for WeightX
* A group box with 3 columns contains 3 fields: every field has `w` = 1 and `weightX` = -1. This leads to 1 row and 3 grid cells which would grow and shrink proportionally because `weightX` is automatically set to > 0.
* If the weight of these 3 fields were set to 0.1, 0.1 and 1, the first two fields would adjust the size very slowly and would mostly be as big as a logical grid column (because `w` is set to 1), whereas the third field would adjust its size very fast.

=== Example for WeightY
* A group box with 1 column contains 3 fields: every field has `h` = 1 and `weightY` = -1. This leads to 3 rows with fixed height, no additional space is grabbed, because `weightY` will automatically be set to 0.
* If the weight of these 3 fields were set to 1, the fields would grow and shrink proportionally.
* If the weight of these 3 fields were set to 0.1, 0.1 and 1, the first two fields would adjust the size very slowly and would mostly be a as big as one logical grid row (because `h` is set to 1), whereas the third field would adjust its size very fast.

== Logical Grid Spy

If you are curious how the logical grid works or have problems arranging your widgets inside a logical grid, the logical grid spy may help you to understand it better.

To enable the spy, open the developer tools of your browser (usually F12), select an element you want to inspect and execute the following command in your console:

.Enable the spy ($0 refers to the selected element)
