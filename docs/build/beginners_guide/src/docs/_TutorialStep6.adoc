This section describes the implementation of the organization form.
For the implementation of the organization form we can apply many of the concepts we have learned in the previous sections.
As a result, the descriptions of this section can be kept on a much higher level.

[[img-contacts_organization_form, Figure 000]]
.The sketch of the organization form layout.

Considering the layout sketch for the organization form shown in <<img-contacts_organization_form>> we can already see how we can reuse the following fields / templates.

* The picture field
* The address box with street, city and country including its validation
* The email field with its validation
* The complete "Notes" tab

For the remaining fields "Name", "Homepage" and "Phone" we will use simple string fields with matching label texts.

We can now implement the company form according to the following steps.

. Expand folder `src/main/java` in the client module in the package explorer
. Select package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.organization` and hit kbd:[Ctrl+N]
. Enter "form" into the search field of the wizard selection and double click on propsal [element]_Scout Form_
. Use "OrganizationForm" as class name and make sure to select all check boxes in the lower part of the wizard
. Click btn:[Finish] to start the Scout form wizard.

After creating the initial form class using Scout's new form wizard the form layout can be implemented according to <<lst-contacts_organization>>.

----

<1> We reuse the picture template field to display the company logo.
<2> We reduce the number of rows for the company logo compared to the person picture.
<3> We configure the company name field to be mandatory for an organization.
<4> As-is reuse of the address template box.
<5> As-is reuse of the email template field.
<6> As-is reuse of the notes tab box.

To be able to open the organization form we need to link the form to the user interface.
Following the pattern for the person form we define the context menus "Edit" and "New" for the organization table and a menu "Create new organization" under the "Quick access" top level menu.

The implementation of the organization form is completed by providing the logic to interact with the database in the organization service according to <<lst-contacts_form_service_organization>>.
The technical setup exactly follows the implementation of the person service.

----

Method `prepareCreate` is not needed for the creation of a new organization and we can remove it from `OrganizationService` and `IOrganizationService`.
Therefore, the implementation of the method `execLoad` in the new handler of the organization form can also be removed.

With these implementations of the organization form and organization service the "Contacts" application can now also be used to maintain a list of organizations.

==== What have we achieved?

In the sixth step of the "Contacts" tutorial we have added the Scout form to edit and create organizations.
The focus of this part of the tutorial was on re-using previous work and applying the concepts that have been introduced in previous tutorial steps.

The "Contacts" application is in a clean state again and you can (re)start the backend and the frontend of the application and verify the result in your browser.
As shown in <<img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_6>> company data can now be viewed and entered in the user interface.
