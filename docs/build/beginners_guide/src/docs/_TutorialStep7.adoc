In this step we modify the user interface to represent the 1:n relationship between organizations and persons.
For the implementation of this 1:n relation we follow the Scout standard pattern.

In the "Contacts" application any person can be assigned to a single organization.
This fact is represented in the database schema created using the statement `SQLs.PERSON_CREATE_TABLE`.

We will therefore need to be able to assign a person to an existing organization by selecting an existing organization in the field.
For this we modify the organization field on the person to a smart field.
To display the assigned organizations we will also modify the person page accordingly.

In addition we would like to be able to easily access all persons assigned to a specific organization.
Using the existing organization page we will add a child page that will then show all associated persons.
This will result in a drill-down functionality for the organization page.

The implementation of the features described above can be achieved by the the following steps.

* <<sec-contacts_company_lookup_call>>
* <<sec-contacts_modify_person_form_and_page>>
* <<sec-contacts_organization_node_page>>

This last tutorial step ends with a short review in section <<sec-contacts_link_person_organization_summary>>

[[sec-contacts_company_lookup_call]]
==== Creating an Organization Lookup Call

Before we can change the organization field on the person form from a string field to a smart field we need a organization lookup call that provides the necessary data to the smartfield.
We have been using this approach for the country field already.
The difference to the lookup call for countries lies in the fact that we no longer have a static list of entries but need to fetch possible the organizations dynamically.
We will therefore need to access the database to provide the data to the lookup call.

As this is a common requirement the Scout framework comes with the base class `AbstractSqlLookupService` and a default mechanism to route lookup calls from the frontend sever to database calls on the backend server.
The necessary infrastructure can be created using the Scout lookup wizard according to the steps described below.

. Expand folder `src/main/java` in the client module in the package explorer
. Select package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.organization` and hit kbd:[Ctrl+N]
. Enter "lookup" into the search field of the wizard selection and double click on propsal [element]_Scout LookupCall_
. Use "OrganizationLookupCall" as class name
. Enter "String" as the key class and use service super class "AbstractSqlLookupService" in the wizard
. Verify that the fields in the wizard match the values provided in <<img-sdk_new_lookupcall_organization>>
. Click btn:[Finish] to start the Scout lookup call wizard.

[[img-sdk_new_lookupcall_organization, Figure 000]]
.Using the Scout lookup call wizard for creating class OrganizationLookupCall.
image::{imgsdir}/sdk_new_lookupcall_organization.png[]

The Scout wizard will then create the lookup class `OrganizationLookupCall` and the corresponding lookup service with the interface `IOrganizationLookupService` and its initial implementation `OrganizationLookupService`.
We will only need to provide some implementation for the lookup service.
The service interface and the lookup call class can be used as provided by the Scout wizard.
<<lst-contacts_lookup_call_organization>> shows the code generated for the lookup call

----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/shared/organization/OrganizationLookupCall.java[tags=all]
----

We are now ready to implement method `getConfiguredSqlSelect` of the organization lookup service.
Open class `OrganizationLookupService` in the Java editor and change the implementation according to <<lst-contacts_lookup_service_organization>>.

[[lst-contacts_lookup_service_organization, Listing OrganizationLookupService]]

----

<1> We only need to return a single SQL statement for lookup services that extend `AbstractSqlLookupService`

The SQL statement that backs the lookup service is provided in <<lst-contacts_lookup_service_sql>>.
Lookup services can provide data for three different use cases.
The most straightforward case is the mapping of a key to a specific lookup row.
Next is the case where the lookup service returns a number of lookup rows that match a provided substring and finally the case where the lookup service simply returns all available rows.

[[sec-contacts_modify_person_form_and_page]]
==== Using the Lookup Call in the Person Form and the Person Table

Now we can use the organization lookup call to transform the organization field in the "Work" tab of the person form into a smart field.
To do this we open class `PersonForm` in the Java editor and navigate to its inner class `WorkBox`.
Then, update the implementation of the OrganizationField according to <<lst-contacts_organization_smart_field>>

[[lst-contacts_organization_smart_field, Listing organization smart field]]
[source,java]
.The organization smart field in the "Work" tab backed by the OrganizationLookupCall.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/person/PersonForm.java[tags=organizationField]
----

<1> The OrganizationField now extends a Scout smart field
<2> The smart field is backed by the newly created organization lookup call

This change has the effect, that now we can assign an organization in the person form by typing a substring of the organizations name into the organization field.
The conversion of the field into a smart field has the additional benefit that only valid organizations can be selected that respect the referential integrity defined by the database.

As a next step we also modify the organization column of the person page.
For this open class `PersonTablePage` in the Java editor and navigate to its inner class `Table`.
Then, change the implementation of `OrganizationColumn` according to <<lst-contacts_organization_smart_column>>.

[[lst-contacts_organization_smart_column, Listing organization smart column]]
[source,java]
.The organization smart column in the person page.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/person/PersonTablePage.java[tags=organizationColumn]
----

Using the created organization lookup calls we have now completed the modifications on the person form and also used the lookup call to display the a person's organization in the person page.
The next section will focus on the necessary modifications and new components to re-use the person page as a sub page of the organization page.

[[sec-contacts_organization_node_page]]
==== Link the Person Page to Organizations

In this section we will implement a drill-down functionality on the organization page.
The goal is to let the user of the application expand a row in the organization page to provide access to the persons of the organization.

Scout node pages are useful when we want to display different entities that are related to a specific entry in a parent page.
In the "Contacts" demo application this mechanism is used to link both persons and events to an organization as shown in <<img-contacts_demo_organization_nodepage>>.
The coloring of the application has been modified to indicate that this is a screenshot of the "Contacts" demo application, not the tutorial application that we are building here.

[[img-contacts_demo_organization_nodepage, Figure 000]]
.A drill-down on an organization in the "Contacts" demo application provides access to related persons and events.
image::{imgsdir}/contacts_demo_organization_nodepage.png[]

In the "Contacts" demo application this hierarchical page structure is implemented as follows.

* Organization page implemented in class `OrganizationTablePage`
** A node page implemented in class `OrganizationNodePage`
*** Person page implemented in class `OrganizationTablePage`
*** Event page implemented in class `EventTablePage`

For the "Contacts" tutorial application we will create the exact same structure but only add the person page as child page to the organization node page.

To implement this sequence of linked pages we will follow the dependencies of the linked classes.
We start with adapting method `getPersonTableData` in the person service by adding an organization id parameter.
Using this parameter we can then restrict the person search to the subset that is linked to the specified organization.
For this change we first update the person service interface as shown in <<lst-contacts_ipersonservice>>.

[[lst-contacts_ipersonservice, Listing IPersonService]]
[source,java]
.The updated method `getPersonTableData` for the person service interface.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/shared/person/IPersonService.java[tags=all]
----

<1> Add parameter `organizationId`

We now adapt the method implementation in the person service according to <<lst-contacts_personservice_organization>>.

// unfortunately, the listing in "contacts" demo app is not a good match for the tutorial
// to keep things simpler we are not including the stuff related to the person search form
[[lst-contacts_personservice_organization, Listing getPersonTableData]]
[source,java]
.Method getPersonTableData to access the database and map the data into a page data object.
----
public class PersonService implements IPersonService {

	@Override
	public PersonTablePageData getPersonTableData(SearchFilter filter, String organizationId) {
		PersonTablePageData pageData = new PersonTablePageData();
		StringBuilder sql = new StringBuilder(SQLs.PERSON_PAGE_SELECT);

		// if an organization is defined, restrict result set to persons that are linked to it
		if (StringUtility.hasText(organizationId)) {
			sql.append(String.format("WHERE LOWER(organization_id) LIKE LOWER('%s') ",
					organizationId));
		}

		sql.append(SQLs.PERSON_PAGE_DATA_SELECT_INTO);
		SQL.selectInto(sql.toString(), new NVPair("page", pageData));

		return pageData;
	}
}
----

Having modified the person service we add a organization id property to the person page.
We can then populate this property when the person page is attached to the company node page.
Finally we can use in method `execLoadData` according to <<lst-contacts_person_page_modification>>.

[[lst-contacts_person_page_modification, Listing person page modification]]
[source,java]
.Add the possibility to restrict the list of persons to those assigned to a specific organization.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/person/PersonTablePage.java[tags=linkToOrganization]
----

<1> This property lets the person page remember an organization key
<2> Provides the organization key to the person search on the backend server
<3> If the user creates a new person below an organization pre-fill the corresponding field

In the cases where the modified person page is shown as a child page of the organization page we can now improve the usability of the page's new menu.
When creating a person under an existing organization we create the new person with a pre-filled organizaion id.
See the modified `execAction` method in `NewMenu` of <<lst-contacts_person_page_modification>>.

The next step in the setup of the page hierarchy is the creation of the organization node page.
Node pages allow to define a list of child pages that typically represent different entities.
As mentioned before we will only have the person page as a child page in the "Contacts" tutorial application.

To create the company node page follow the steps listed below.

. Expand folder `src/main/java` in the client module in the package explorer
. Select package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.organization` and hit kbd:[Ctrl+N]
. Enter "scout page" into the search field of the wizard selection and double click on propsal [element]_Scout Page_
. Add "Organization" to the class name field
. Switch the super class field to "AbstractPageWithNodes"
. Verify that the fields in the wizard match the values provided in <<img-sdk_new_organization_nodepage>>
. Click btn:[Finish] to start the Scout page wizard

[[img-sdk_new_organization_nodepage, Figure 000]]
.Creating the organization node page.
image::{imgsdir}/sdk_new_organization_nodepage.png[]

After the wizard has created the initial implementation of the node page open class `OrganizationNodePage` in the Java editor and adapt its implementation accordin to <<lst-contacts_organization_node_page>>.

[[lst-contacts_organization_node_page, Listing OrganizationNodePage]]
[source,java]
.The complete implementation of the class `OrganizationNodePage`.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/organization/OrganizationNodePage.java[tags=all]
----

<1> The organization id property that represents the selected organization in the parent page
<2> Method `execCreateChildPages` defines the list of child pages
<3> Define the organization id property for the person child page

We have now created a organization node page that contains a person page as its child page.
The only missing step to create the discussed page hierarchy is the link between the organization page with the organization node page.
Create this missing link by adding method `execCreateChildPage` to the organization page as shown in <<lst-contacts_organization_page_modification>>.

[[lst-contacts_organization_page_modification, Listing modified OrganizationTablePage]]
[source,java]
.Add the organization node page as a child page to the organization page.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/organization/OrganizationTablePage.java[tags=childPage]
----

The difference between Scout table pages and node pages is also reflected in the different signatures of `AbstractPageWithTable.execCreateChildPage` and `AbstractPageWithNodes.execCreateChildPages`.
Table pages can have a single child page while node pages may contain a list of child pages.


[[sec-contacts_link_person_organization_summary]]
==== What have we achieved?

In the seventh step of the "Contacts" tutorial we have introduced a typical Scout user interface pattern for 1:n relationships.
We have created a dynamic lookup call and used the lookup call to provide the data for a smart field and a smart column.

To implement a drill-down functionality for the organization table we have created a page hierarchy using the existing organization page and person page.
To link the two table pages we have also created and integrated a Scout node page.

The "Contacts" application is in a clean state again and you can (re)start the backend and the frontend of the application and verify the result in your browser.
As shown in <<img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_7>> the organization specific person data is now presented in a hierarchical form in the navigation area of the application.

[[img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_7, Figure 000]]
.The linked person page only shows person related to the parent organization page.
