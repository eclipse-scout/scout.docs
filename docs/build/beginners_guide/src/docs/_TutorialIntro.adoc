=== The "`Contacts`" Application

The "`Contacts`" demo application is a client server application to manage personal contacts, organizations and events.
The persistence of entered data is achieved via simple JDBC access to a Derby database.

It is recommended that you first import the full "`Contacts`" demo application as described in the Eclipse Scout User Guide into a separate workspace.
This gives you the possibility to check your source code against the full implementation during the various steps of the tutorial.
Alternatively, you can also view the source code of the "`Contacts`" demo application on Github.footnote:[
"`Contacts`" on Github: https://github.com/BSI-Business-Systems-Integration-AG/org.eclipse.scout.docs/tree/releases/6.0.x/code/contacts
].

Figure <<img-app_contacts_personpage>> below shows the "`Contacts`" application after connecting to the Scout UI application.

The "`Contacts`" application also shows the basic user interface layout of a typical Scout application.
The main areas of this layout are briefly introduced below.

Outline Button:: In <<img-app_contacts_personpage>> the top left area shows a folder icon that represents the "Contacts" outline.
The small down arrow at the folder icon indicates that additional outlines are available when clicking on this view button.
On the right of to button with the folder icon is second outline button that activates a search outline (not implemented yet).
Navigation Tree:: The navigation tree on the left side of the layout shows the pages that are available for the selected outline.
For the "Contacts" outline, the navigation tree provides access to the pages "Persons", "Organizations" and "Events".
Selecting a page then shows associated information on the right hand side in the bench area.
In the case of the selected "Persons" page the bench area shows a list of persons in the form of a table.
Header:: The header area is located at the top and holds the available top level menus.
In this example these are the "Quick access", "Options" menu points as well as a user menu that shows the username of the currently logged in user "mzi".
Bench:: The bench represents the main display area of a Scout application.
When selecting the "Persons" page, a table provides access to all available persons as shown in <<img-app_contacts_personpage>>.
Selecting a specific person the provides access to all actions that are available for the selected person.
The selected person can then be opened with the [menu]_Edit_ menu which opens the person in a view that is displayed in the bench area again as shown in <<img-app_contacts_personform>>.

For entering and editing of data in Scout applications views are used in most cases.
Views are displayed in the bench area of a Scout application.
Several views can also be opened simultaneously.
To show a specific view the user has to click on the view button associated with the desired view.
An example of an opened view is shown for person "Alice" in in <<img-app_contacts_personform>>.

=== Tutorial Overview

This tutorial walks you through the implementation of a Scout application consisting of a frontend and a backend application.
The frontend application contains outlines with navigation trees, pages to present information in tabular form and forms to view and edit data.
In the backend appliation the tutorial shows how to implement services, logging, databases access, and serveral other aspects of Scout applications.

The tutorial is organized into the sequence of the consecutive steps listed below.
Each of the step is described in a individual section that results in a executable application that can be tested and compared against the full "Contacts" demo application.

Step 1: <<sec-contacts_initial_project>>::
We start with an empty workspace and the "Hello World" project.
At the end of step one we have a project setup that matches the "Contacts" application.
This includes the organization and naming of Maven modules and the individual Java packages.

Step 2: <<sec-contacts_pages>>::
The second step adds the user interface components to display persons and organizations.
For this a "Persons" page and an "Organizations" page are created and added to the "Contacts" outline as shown in <<img-app_contacts_personpage>>.

Step 3: <<sec-contacts_jdbc>>::
This step concentrates on the backend of the "Contacts" application.
The covered topics includes dealing with application properties, setup and access of a database and using the database to povide data for the person and organization page created in the previous step.

Step 4: <<sec-contacts_forms>>::
Having access to the database is used in this step to add the components that allow a user to create and edit persons in the user interface of the "Contacts" application.
In addition, this tutorial step also demonstrates how to design and implement complex form layouts with the Scout framework.

Step 5: <<sec-contacts_fields>>::
This step provides an introduction into form field validation and the creation of template fields.
Validation of user input is important for many business applications and template fields help to improve code quality with a mechanism to reuse application specific user interface components.

Step 6: <<sec-contacts_form_add_company>>::
We create the organization form to create and enter organizations in the "Contacts" application.
As we can reuse many of the components developed so far this is the shortest tutorial step.

Step 7: <<sec-contacts_link_organization_person>>::
In this step we modify the user interface to implement a 1:n relationship between organizations and persons.
This includes the creation of a hierarchical page structure for organization, adding an organization column to the person page and adding an organization field to the person form to manage the association of a person to an organization.

Step 8: <<sec-contacts_outlook>>::
The last tutorial part discusses the gap between the tutorial application and the complete "Contacts" demo application.
