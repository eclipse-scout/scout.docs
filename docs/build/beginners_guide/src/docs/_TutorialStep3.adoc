This tutorial step shows how Scout applications can interact with databases via JDBC.
Due to the clean layering implemented in the "Contacts" application only the Scout backend server connects to the database.
We therefore focus on the Scout backend in this part of the tutorial.

For the "Contacts" application we will work with a https://db.apache.org/derby/index.html[Derby database].
The choice of Derby is based on the fact that no additional installation is required and it is possible to work with in-memory databases.

We start this tutorial step with copying the classes that handle the database creation/access from the full "Contacts" demo application as described in <<sec-contacts_jdbc_infra>>.
The setup is then explained in the following sections.

* <<sec-contacts_jdbc_properties>>
* <<sec-contacts_jdbc_sql>>
* <<sec-contacts_jdbc_initial_db>>

With the basic infrastructure in place we review the existing "Contacts" backend to answer the question <<sec-contacts_jdbc_starting>>.
In section <<sec-contacts_jdbc_fetching_data>> we then add the missing pieces.

At the end of this tutorial step the "Contacts" backend server provides person and organization data to the frontend server as summarized in <<sec-contacts_jdbc_summary>>.


[[sec-contacts_jdbc_infra]]
==== Adding the Infrastructure

This section describes the installation of the necessary components and classes that handle the database creation/access of the "Contacts" application.

To add the support for the Scout JDBC components and the Derby database we first need to declare the corresponding dependencies in the pom.xml file of the Maven server module.
This can be done using the following steps.

* Expanding the Maven module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server` in the Eclipse Package Explorer
* Open the `pom.xml` file (use a double click on the file in the package explorer) and switch to the "pom.xml" tab in the Maven POM Editor.
* Add the database related dependencies according to <<lst-contacts_db_pom>>

[[lst-contacts_db_pom, Listing additional Maven dependencies]]
[source,xml]
.The additional dependencies needed in the server pom.xml to use the derby database
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server/pom.xml[tags=Derby]
----

<1> Add the `derby` and the `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.jdbc` dependencies to the pom.xml of your "Contacts" server module.

After adding the database dependencies to the server's pom.xml file we need to update all Maven server modules for the "Contacts" app.
To do this, select the three modules `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.*` and hit kbd:[Alt+F5] as shown in <<img-contacts_tutorial_update_server_modules>>.
Start the update with btn:[OK].

[[img-contacts_tutorial_update_server_modules, Figure 000]]
.Update the Maven server modules for the "Contacts" application.
image::{imgsdir}/contacts_tutorial_update_server_modules.png[]

The next step is to create the `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.sql` package.

* Expand folder `src/main/java` of Maven module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server`
* Select the existing package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server` and hit kbd:[Ctrl+N]
* This opens the dialog to select a wizard. Enter "package" into the search field
* Select the [wizard]_New Java Package_ wizard with a double click on the Java [element]_Package_ proposal
* Enter `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.sql` into the [field]_Name_ field of the wizard and click btn:[Finish]

We are now ready to copy the classes related to the database infrastructure from the "Contacts" demo application to our tutorial workspace.

The simplest way to do this is to open a second Eclipse IDE with the workspace where you have imported the Scout demo applications.
If you have not done this yet go to the beginning of this tutorial <<cha-large_example>> and catch up now.

In the demo application workspace navigate to the same package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.sql` and copy over all its classes.
After copying these classes make sure that the structure of your server Maven module looks as shown in <<img-contacts_tutorial_copied_db_classes>>.

[[img-contacts_tutorial_copied_db_classes, Figure 000]]
.The copied database classes in the tutorial workspace.
image::{imgsdir}/contacts_tutorial_copied_db_classes.png[]

The imported classes are described in the following sections.
Additional information is provided where these classes are relying on Scout concepts that have not previously been introduced.

[[sec-contacts_jdbc_properties]]
==== Scout Config Properties

Scout Config properties can greatly improve the flexibility of Scout applications.
For the "Contacts" application this feature is used to keep its database setup configurable.
Moving from a in-memory setup to a disk based database is then possible without any reprogramming.

The Scout backend (and frontent) applications initialize config properties from matching values found in file `config.properties`.
For missing property values the default values defined in the config property classes are used.

In the case of the "Contacts" application the config property files are located in the subfolder `src/main/resources` of the Maven modules that specify the frontend and the backend application.

* Expand Maven module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.app.dev`
* Expand subfolder `src/main/resources`
* Open file `config.properties` in the text editor
* Append all properties defined in <<lst-contacts_database_props>> to the file

[[lst-contacts_database_props, Listing database properties]]
[source]
.Properties relevant for creating and accessing the database.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server.app.dev/src/main/resources/config.properties[tags=databaseProperties]
----

These added property values then match the config properties defined in the class `DatabaseProperties` provided in <<lst-contacts_props>>.
Remember that this is one of the database infrastructure classes we have copied before.

[[lst-contacts_props, Listing config properties]]
[source,java]
.Typed properties for the "Contacts" application
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/server/sql/DatabaseProperties.java[tags=structure]
----

<1> Defines the default value of the property that is used if the property is not defined in file config.properties
<2> Defines the key to be used in file config.properties

In the Scout framework config properties are always typed and need to implement interface `IConfigProperty`.
For commonly used types Scout already provides classes.
A boolean property may be created by extending Scout class `AbstractBooleanConfigProperty`.

Accessing the actual property values in the code is demonstrated in the next section.

[[sec-contacts_jdbc_sql]]
==== The SQL Service and SQL Statements

Accessing databases with the Scout framework is implemented with SQL services that extend base class `AbstractSqlService`.
As the "Contacts" application will be working with a Derby database we also need a Derby specific SQL service.

This is why we have copied over class `DerbySqlService`.
The only project specific method is `getConfiguredJdbcMappingName` as implemented in <<lst-contacts_derby_service>>.

[[lst-contacts_derby_service, Listing DerbySqlService]]
[source,java]
.The Derby SQL service to connect to the database
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/server/sql/DerbySqlService.java[tags=service]
----

<1> Check the https://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.11/ref/rrefattrib24612.html[Derby documentation] for additional attributes.

This listing also demonstrates how to use the config properties in the code.
With the property values defined in the previous section the "Contacts" application is working with an in-memory database.

To change the setup to a disk based version, we would have to change the value for the property `contacts.database.jdbc.mapping.name`
from `jdbc:derby:memory:contacts-database` to `jdbc:derby:<path-to-dir>`.
For a Windows box a concrete example could look like this: `jdbc:derby:c:\\derby\\contacts-database`.

Now we look at how the actual SQL statements of the "Contacts" application work.
For our application all statements are collected into a single class.
While there are many more options how to organize SQL and Java code this setup has its own advantages.

* Efficient maintenance as all SQL statements are located in a single place
* Code completion support in the Eclipse IDE when using the statements
* The setup is easy to explain

The SQL statements related to the database structure are provided in <<lst-contacts_sql_createdb>>.
The statements (or building blocks of statments) in class `SQLs` are plain SQL in many cases.
In the other cases the statement texts include Scout specific syntax extensions with `:` as a prefix character.
Examples are `:<identifier>` and `:{<identifier>.<attribute>}`.

----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/server/sql/SQLs.java[tags=createDB]
----

<1> The syntax ':identifier' adds convenience and is supported by the Scout framework

The next section discusses how the components introduced above are used by the "Contacts" appliction to create an initial "Contacts" database during the startup phase of the application.

[[sec-contacts_jdbc_initial_db]]
==== The Database Setup Service

The database setup service is responsible to create the "Contacts" database during the startup of the application.
In order to implement such a service, a number of Scout concepts are combined into class `DatabaseSetupService`.

* Access config properties using class `CONFIG`
* Executing SQL statements via class `SQL`
* Logging via class `LOG`
* Scout platform with the annotations `@ApplicationScoped`, `@CreateImmediately` and `@PostConstruct`

How these elements are used in class `DatabaseSetupService` is shown in <<lst-contacts_dbsetup_service>>.
The actual creation of the "Contacts" database is performed by method `autoCreateDatabase`.

At the time of the database creation no user is yet logged into the application.
This is why we use a run context associated with the super user.
The context is then used to execute the runnable that creates the organization and person tables.

[[lst-contacts_dbsetup_service, Listing DatabaseSetupService]]
[source,java]
.Class DatabaseSetupService to create the database tables for the "Contacts" application.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/server/sql/DatabaseSetupService.java[tags=service]
----

<1> The existing tables are stored in the `StringArrayHolder` object named "result".

The usage of `CONFIG` is already covered by the previous section.
Introductions for `SQL`, `LOG` and the Scout platform annotations are provided below.

Logging::
Scout uses the http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html[SLF4J] framework for logging.
For the actual implementation of the loggers Scout uses http://logback.qos.ch/[Logback] per default.
To use logging a local logger is first created using the SLF4J `LoggerFactory` class.
Additional information regarding the logging configuration is provided below.

Executing SQL Statements::
For the execution of SQL statements Scout provides the convenience class `SQL`.
The various methods can be used with a simple SQL command as in `SQL.insert(mySqlCommand)` or using additional named objects as in `SQL.insertInto(mySqlCommand, myHolder)`.
The Scout class `NVPair` is frequently used to create such named objects.
Make sure that the identifiers (using the Scout `:` syntax) provided in the SQL commands always match with the names associated with the named objects.

Scout Platform::
The Scout platform provides the basic infrastructure and a number of services to a Scout application.
Services are represented by Scout beans that are registered at startup with the platform and created once they are needed.
For class `DatabaseSetupService` we can use the Scout annotation `@ApplicationScoped` to register the service and to make sure that there will only be a single instance of this class.
To force the creation of a bean `DatabaseSetupService` at startup time we also add Scout annotation `@CreateImmediately`.
Finally, the annotation `@PostConstruct` executes our method `autoCreateDatabase` as soon as the `DatabaseSetupService` bean is created.

Changing the basic log level of an application is a frequently used scenario.
As Scout is using Logback per default we can adapt the log level in the `logback.xml` configuration files as shown in <<lst-contacts_logback_loglevel>>.
For the "Contacts" application these configuration files are located in folder `src/main/resources` of the Maven modules that define the frontend and the backend applications.
More information regarding these configuration files is provided in the http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html[Logback manual].

[[lst-contacts_logback_loglevel, Listing Logback configuration]]

<configuration>
  <root level="INFO"> <!--1-->
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
    <appender-ref ref="STDERR" />
  </root>
</configuration>
----

<1> The `level` attribute of the `<root>` element is used as the basic log level. Try "DEBUG" or "WARN" as alternative values.

[[sec-contacts_jdbc_starting]]
==== What is missing?

This section reviews the backend infrastructure that has been created so far and identifies the pieces that are missing to fetch person and organization data to send it to the frontend server of the "Contacts" application.

During the creation of the person page and the organization page the Scout wizards created more than just Scout pages that are visible in the user interface.
It also added corresponding classes in the shared module and the server module of the "Contacts" application.

The new page wizard basically added the complete round trip from the client (frontend server) to the server (backend server) and back.
Using the organization page as an example, the setup created by the page wizard involves the following classes.

* Class `OrganizationTablePage` with method `execLoadData` in the client module
* The service interface `IOrganizationService` and class `OrganizationTablePageData` in the shared module
* Class `OrganizationService` with the method stub `getOrganizationTableData` in the server module

On the client side the server roundtrip is implemented in method `execLoadData` as shown in <<lst-contacts_organization_page_loaddata>>.

[[lst-contacts_organization_page_loaddata, Listing loading data from the server]]
[source,java]
.Accessing the "Contacts" backend server to fetch organization data.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/organization/OrganizationTablePage.java[tags=execLoadData]
----

This roundtrip between class `OrganizationTablePage` and `OrganizationService` works through the following steps.

. `BEANS.get(IOrganizationService.class)` returns a reference to a client proxy service
. Method `getOrganizationTableData(filter)` is executed on the corresponding server service
. This method returns the organization data in the form of an `OrganizationTablePageData` object
. Method `importPageData` transfers the data from the page data into the table of the user interface

On the server side fetching the data from the database will be implemented in class `OrganizationService` according to <<lst-contacts_organization_page_getdata>>.

[[lst-contacts_organization_page_getdata, Listing getTableData]]
[source,java]
.Method getTableData to access the database and map the data into a pageData object.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/server/organization/OrganizationService.java[tags=getTableData]
----

In the next section we will implement the database access logic in the `getOrganizationTableData` methods of the server classes `OrganizationService` and `PersonService`.


[[sec-contacts_jdbc_fetching_data]]
==== Fetching Organization and Person Data

We are now ready to fetch data from the Derby database using the available infrastructure and the SQL statements prepared in class `SQLs`.
For the implementation of method `getOrganizationTableData` in class `OrganizationService` we will use the two SQL snippet provided in <<lst-contacts_sql_list_org>>.

[[lst-contacts_sql_list_org, Listing SELECT FROM ORGANIZATION]]
[source,java]
.Interface SQLs with the SQL to fetch the list of organizations with their attributes.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/server/sql/SQLs.java[tags=organizationListing]
----

<1> The syntax ':{identifier.attribute}' adds convenience to map SQL result sets to Scout page data objects.

Taking advantage of the SQL convenience offered by the Scout framework, we can add the missing functionality with two lines of code.
See <<lst-contacts_fetch_orgs>> for the full listing of method `getOrganizationTableData`.
After adding the two additional lines, we update the imports of the classes with pressing kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+O].

[[lst-contacts_fetch_orgs, Listing OrganizationService]]
[source,java]
.Method getTableData to access the database and map the data into a pageData object.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/server/organization/OrganizationService.java[tags=getTableData;allOrgs]
----

<1> Added line 1: Assembling of the SQL statement
<2> Added line 2: Fetching the data from the database and storing the result in `pageData`

Note that the identifier "page" in the NVPair object will be mapped to the same identifier used in the `ORGANIZATION_PAGE_DATA_SELECT_INTO` statement.

Finally, we have to also implement the loading of the person data in class `PersonService`.
The implementation of method `getPersonTableData` is provided in <<lst-contacts_fetch_pers>>.

// unfortunately, the listing in "contacts" demo app is not a good match for the tutorial
// to keep things simpler we are not including the stuff related to the person search form
[[lst-contacts_fetch_pers, Listing PersonService]]
[source,java]
.Method getPersonTableData to access the database and map the data into a page data object.
----
public class PersonService implements IPersonService {

	@Override
	public PersonTablePageData getPersonTableData(SearchFilter filter) {
		PersonTablePageData pageData = new PersonTablePageData();

		String sql = SQLs.PERSON_PAGE_SELECT + SQLs.PERSON_PAGE_DATA_SELECT_INTO;
	    SQL.selectInto(sql, new NVPair("page", pageData));

	    return pageData;
	}
}
----

[[sec-contacts_jdbc_summary]]
==== What have we achieved?

In the third step of the "Contacts" tutorial we have added the infrastructure to work with a Derby database.
The infrastructure is used to create and populate the initial database.
In addition person and organization data is now fetched from the database on the "Contacts" backend server and handed to the "Contacts" frontend server via a page data object.

The "Contacts" application is in a clean state again and you can (re)start the backend and the frontend of the application and verify the result in your browser.
Person and company data is now visible in the user interface as shown in <<img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_3>>.
