In the second step of the Scout tutorial the components to display persons and organizations are added to the "Contacts" outline of the user interface of the Scout application.
Specifically, a "Persons" page and an "Organizations" page are created and added to the navigation tree of the "Contacts" outline.

Database access and populating the pages with actual data from the database is not part of this section but will be covered in section <<sec-contacts_jdbc>> in the next tutorial step.

The addition of the "Persons" page is described in detail in the sections listed below.

* <<sec-contacts_creating_person_package>>
* <<sec-contacts_country_lookup_call>>
* <<sec-contacts_creating_person_page>>
* <<sec-contacts_adding_page_columns>>
* <<sec-contacts_link_person_page>>

The addition of the company page is described in <<sec-contacts_adding_company_page>>.
Finally, the state of the "Contacts" application is summarized in section <<sec-contacts_summary_step_2>>.

[[sec-contacts_creating_person_package]]
==== Creating additional Packages

A substantial part of the "Contacts" application deals with persons.
In addition to the "Persons" page we will also add a Scout form to enter/edit persons in a later tutorial step.
For the "Contacts" application we use this fact to justify the addition of a specific Java package that will hold all classes related to persons.
This person package can be created with the following steps.

* Open the "Contacts" Maven module `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client` in the Eclipse Package Explorer
* Select the Java package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client` in folder `src/main/java`
* Press kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[N], enter "package" into the search field
* Select the [wizard]_Package_ wizard in the proposal box and click [button]_Next_
* Enter `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.person` and click [button]_Finish_ as shown in <<img-contacts_person_package>>
* Make sure the newly created person package is selected in the Eclipse Package Explorer

[[img-contacts_person_package, Figure 000]]
.Add the person package to the "Contacts" application.
image::{imgsdir}/sdk_new_package_wizard.png[]

We will also need a separate package for organizations and some common elements.

* Add package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.organization`
* Add package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.common`

[[sec-contacts_country_lookup_call]]
==== Creating the Country Lookup Call

The pages for the persons and the organizations will also display country information.
To display country names we will be using a special column, that maps the country codes received from the backend application to translated country names.
As the Java class `Locale` already contains both country codes and country names we can take advantage of this class and use it in a Scout local lookup call.

In package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.common` create a new class `CountryLookupCall` according to the implementation provided in <<lst-contacts_country_lookup>>.

[[lst-contacts_country_lookup, Listing Countries lookup call]]
[source,java]
.The Scout lookup call for countries. This lookup call will be used for the address field.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/common/CountryLookupCall.java[tags=all]
----

<1> Makes the `CountryLookupCall` to work with key type `String`
<2> Defines the set of lookup rows to be used
<3> Add a row with the country code as key and the country name as display value

[[sec-contacts_creating_person_page]]
==== Creating the Person Page

In this section we create the Scout page that will be used to list all entered persons to the user of the "Contacts" application.
Out-of-the box this page will support the sorting and filtering of all the persons.
This "Persons" page is then added to the navigation tree below the "Contacts" outline.

We can now add the Scout person page as described below.

* Select the newly created package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.person` in the Package Explorer
* Press kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[N], enter "scout page" into the search field
* Select the [wizard]_Scout Page_ wizard in the proposal box and click [button]_Next_
* Enter `PersonTablePage` as the class name and click [button]_Finish_ as shown in <<img-contacts_new_person_page>>

[[img-contacts_new_person_page, Figure 000]]
.Add the person page to the "Contacts" application.
image::{imgsdir}/sdk_new_personpage_wizard.png[]

The Scout [wizard]_New Page Wizard_ then creates an initial implementation for the `PersonTablePage` class very similar to the listing provided in <<lst-contacts_PersonTable>> below.

[[lst-contacts_PersonTable, Listing PersonTablePage]]
[source,java]
.Initial implementation of class PersonTablePage.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/person/PersonTablePage.java[tags=PageInit]
----

Before we start to add the columns to the table of the page we need to do some minor adaptations to <<lst-contacts_PersonTable>>.

<1> Specify the title "Persons" for the page using the Scout NLS tooling (see <<sec-add_text_entry>>)
<2> You don't need to update method `execLoadData` to match this listing for now
<3> Add method `getConfiguredLeaf` to specify that the person page will not have any child pages
<4> We will add the columns in the next section of this tutorial

We are now ready to populate the inner class `Table` of the person page with the columns to display various person attributes.

[[sec-contacts_adding_page_columns]]
==== Adding Table Columns to the Page

Table pages are an important UI element of Scout applications as they frequently play a central role in the interactions of a user with the application.
Out of the box table pages offer powerful options to sort, filter and re-arrange the data contained in the table.
This functionality offers a good starting point to decide which columns to add to a table page.

To decide the columns to add the following criterias have been useful in practice.

* Unique identifier of an element
* Attributes that are most frequently used in searches
* Category attributes that are useful for filtering
* Fewer columns are better

WARNING: As the visible data of all users is held in the memory of the frontend server it is good practice to keep the number of columns as low as possible.
Not taking this advice into account can substantially increase the memory footprint of the frontend server in production.

For the person page of the "Contacts" application we will add the following columns.

* *PersonId*: Hidden attribute of type string to hold the person key. Class name: `PersonIdColumn`
* *First Name*: String column. Class name: `FirstNameColumn`
* *Last Name* String column. Class name: `LastNameColumn`
* *City*: String column. Class name: `CityColumn`
* *Country*: Smart column. Class name: `CountryColumn`
* *Phone*: String column, not visible per default. Class name: `PhoneColumn`
* *Mobile Phone*: String column, not visible per default. Class name: `MobileColumn`
* *Email*: String column, not visible per default. Class name: `EmailColumn`
* *Organization*: String column, not visible per default. Class name: `OrganizationColumn`

TIP: Use the column class names as indicated above.
Working with different names is possible but requires additional work later in the tutorial when the data retrieved from the database is mapped to these column class names.

To add the first column `PersonIdColumn` we open class `PersonTable` in the Java editor and place the cursor inside of the body of the inner `Table` class.
We then open the Scout content assist with kbd:[Ctrl+Space] and select the [element]_Column_ proposal as shown in <<img-sdk_new_page_column_contacts>>.

[[img-sdk_new_page_column_contacts, Figure 000]]
.Adding a column to the person page table.
image::{imgsdir}/sdk_new_page_column_contacts.png[]

In the first edit box we type "PersonId" as shown in <<img-sdk_new_page_column_personid>> and press kbd:[Enter].

[[img-sdk_new_page_column_personid, Figure 000]]
.Adding a column to the person page table.
image::{imgsdir}/sdk_new_page_column_personid.png[]

To configure this column as an invisible primary key we modify the newly created column class according to <<lst-contacts_PersonIdColumn>>.

[[lst-contacts_PersonIdColumn, Listing PersonIdColumn]]
[source,java]
.Implementation of the person primary key column PersonIdColumn.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/person/PersonTablePage.java[tags=PersonIdColumn]
----
<1> Returning `false` here makes this column invisible. As this column will be excluded from the table control the user is not aware of the existence of this column.
<2> Returning `true` marks this attibute as a primary key (or part of a primary key)

We can now add the additional columns `FirstNameColumn`, `LastNameColumn`, `CityColumn` below.
After entering the class name press kbd:[Tab] twice to move the cursor to the label text of the field.
In the case of the first name enter "FirstName" and hit kbd:[Ctrl+Space] to open the wizard to add the translated text "First Name" as described in <<sec-add_text_entry>>.

For these three columns the default implementation is fine and does not need any adaptations.
<<lst-contacts_FirstNameColumn>> below provides an example for this type of columns.

[[lst-contacts_FirstNameColumn, Listing FirstNameColumn]]
[source,java]
.Implementation of the first name column.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/person/PersonTablePage.java[tags=FirstNameColumn]
----

For column `CountryColumn` we will use a smart column.
We again use kbd:[Ctrl+Space] to open the wizard and enter "Country" for the class name box and press kbd:[Tab] once and select [element]_AbstractSmartColumn_ as column type.
Next we press kbd:[Tab] again to enter "Country" as the translated text.

In the created class `CountryColumn` we need to update the class to extend `AbstractSmartColumn<String>` and add the method `getConfiguredLookupCall` according to <<lst-contacts_CountryColumn>>.

[[lst-contacts_CountryColumn, Listing CountryColumn]]
[source,java]
.Implementation of the country smart column.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/person/PersonTablePage.java[tags=CountryColumn]
----

<1> The configured lookup call is used to map country codes to the country names used in the user interface.

After the country column we add the three columns `PhoneColumn`, `MobileColumn`, `EmailColumn` and `OrganizationColumn` that are initially not visible in the user interface.
As an example for such a column <<lst-contacts_PhoneColumn>> is provided below.

[[lst-contacts_PhoneColumn, Listing PhoneColumn]]
[source,java]
.Implementation of the (initially invisible) phone column.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/person/PersonTablePage.java[tags=PhoneColumn]
----

<1> Returning `false` hides the column initially. Using the table control the user can then make this column visible in the user interface.

TIP: Use the Eclipse content assist to efficiently add method `getConfiguredVisible`.
Place the cursor after method `getConfiguredHeaderText`, type "getConVis" and hit kbd:[Ctrl+Space].
Then select the proposal [element]_getConfiguredVisible_ with kbd:[Enter] and the method is inserted for you.

We have now created a person page with corresponding table columns.
However, this new UI component is not yet visible in the user interface.
What is missing is the link from the application's contacts outline class to the newly created `PersonTablePage` class.
This is what we will do in the following section.

[[sec-contacts_link_person_page]]
==== Link the Person Page to the Contacts Outline

In this section we add the person page to the contacts outline created during the initial project setup of the first step of this tutorial.
This will make the person page visible in the navigation area below the "Contacts" outline.

For this we have to add a single line of code to method `execCreateChildPages` of class `ContactOutline` according to <<lst-contacts_add_person_page>>

[[lst-contacts_add_person_page, Listing adding the person page]]
[source,java]
.Adding the PersonTable to the ContactOutline.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/contact/ContactOutline.java[tags=execCreateChildPagesPerson]
----

<1> A new instance of the `PersonTable` is added to this outline. This makes the person page visible in the navigation area below the contacts outline.

Before we can save the class `ContactOutline` we have to update its imports to include the import statement for class `PersonTablePage`.
To update the imports you can either user the menu menu:Source[Organize Imports] or use the keyboard shortcut kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+O].

The application is now in a state where we can restart the backend and the frontend server to verify our changes in the user interface.

[[sec-contacts_adding_company_page]]
==== Adding the Company Page

This section creates and adds a table page for organization to the "Contacts" outline.
To create an organizations page the same steps are required as for the creation of the person page.
The description is therefore kept on a higher level and in the text below only the main steps are described.
Where appropriate, pointers are provided to the detailed descriptions for the creation of the person page.

* Add client package `org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client.organization`
* Add page `OrganizationTablePage` with title "Organizations" using the Scout new page wizard

[[lst-contacts_OrganizationTablePage, Listing OrganizationTablePage]]
[source,java]
.Initial implementation of class OrganizationTablePage.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/organization/OrganizationTablePage.java[tags=PageInit]
----

<1> Make sure to add a translated text entry for "Organizations" using the Scout NLS tooling

The implementation of class `OrganizationTablePage` using the Scout new page wizard then looks as shown in <<lst-contacts_OrganizationTablePage>>.

As in the case of the person page you can now add the columns for the inner `Table` class.
For the organization page add the columns according to the specification provided below.

* *OrganizationId*: Hidden attribute of type string to hold the organization key. Class name: `OrganizationIdColumn`
* *Name*: String column. Class name: `NameColumn`
* *City*: String column. Class name: `CityColumn`
* *Country*: Smart column. Class name: `CountryColumn`
* *Homepage*: String column, not visible per default. Class name: `HomepageColumn`

As in the case of the person page we have to add the newly created class `OrganizationTablePage` in method `execCreateChildPages` of the outline class `ContactOutline` as shown in <<lst-contacts_add_organization_page>>.

[[lst-contacts_add_organization_page, Listing adding the organization page to the outline]]
[source,java]
.Adding the OrganizationTablePage to the ContactOutline.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/contact/ContactOutline.java[tags=execCreateChildPagesPerson;execCreateChildPagesOrganization]
----

<1> The pages will appear in the user interface according to the order in which they are added to the outline.

[[sec-contacts_summary_step_2]]
==== What have we achieved?

In the second step of the "Contacts" tutorial we have created a person page and an organization page to display data of persons and organizations.

The "Contacts" application is in a clean state again and you can (re)start the backend and the frontend of the application and verify the user interface in your browser.
The user interface should look like the screenshot provided in <<img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_2>>.

[[img-contacts_tutorial_result_step_2, Figure 000]]
.The "Contacts" application with the person and organization pages at the end of tutorial step 2.
image::{imgsdir}/contacts_tutorial_result_step_2.png[]

When comparing the state of the "Contacts" tutorial application with the Scout demo application in <<img-app_contacts_personpage>> the main difference is the missing person data.
Adding access to a database is the focus of the next tutorial step.
