After installing the Eclipse Scout package you are now ready to create your first Scout application.

== Create a Scout Project

include::{mdledir}/CreateNewProject.adoc[]

== Run the Application

include::{mdledir}/RunTheApplication.adoc[]

== What's Next?

Now that you have successfully created your first Scout application, you might want to learn more about Scout.
To gain experience with Scout we recommend looking at the beginner's guide.

For this, we are writing the Scout books.
