After installing the Eclipse Scout package you are ready for testing the SDK version

== Precondition

Before executing the SDK tests described below, make sure that you already have (at least) checked that the Scout Hello World is working properly.

== Verify Version


. Open Eclipse About dialog
. Click on Eclipse Scout project button
. Check Scout SDK feature version
. Click on button Plug-in Details
. Check Scout SDK plug-in version (same as feature version)

SDK Version Check:

- [ ] Scout SDK version matches expected version for testing.

== Test Code Completion

- [ ] Open HelloWorld Form and create a new form field using Ctrl+Space. Ensure the Scout Templates (E.g. StringField, TableField) are available.
- [ ] Select a Template. The corresponding code is inserted and edit locations can be switched using Tab key.
- [ ] When moving to a super class by using the Tab key, ensure the possible super class proposals are displayed.
TODO: Add screenshot for super class proposal test.

== Test DTO update

- [ ] Ensure the newly created form field (test before) is reflected in the corresponding form data (DTO auto update).

== Test NLS

- [ ] When pressing Ctrl+Space in a TEXTS.get("") statement ensure the NLS proposals are displayed and that a new one can be created
- [ ] Open the *.nls file and test that the NLS Editor opens and that new entries can be created.

== Test ClassId creation

- [ ] Press the menu Scout -> Create all missing @Classid Annotations and ensure they are correctly created.

== Test Wizards Small Set
- [ ] Create a new Form (Ctrl+N) and verify that it is created correctly (no compilation errors)
- [ ] Create a new Table Page (Ctrl+N) and verify that it is created correctly (no compilation errors)

== Test Wizards Full Set

- [ ] Create a new CodeType (Ctrl+N) and verify that it is created correctly (no compilation errors)
- [ ] Create a new Form (Ctrl+N) and verify that it is created correctly (no compilation errors)
- [ ] Create a new LookupCall (Ctrl+N) and verify that it is created correctly (no compilation errors)
- [ ] Create a new Table Page (Ctrl+N) and verify that it is created correctly (no compilation errors)
- [ ] Create a new Permission (Ctrl+N) and verify that it is created correctly (no compilation errors)
