The Eclipse Scout package also includes Scout specific tooling, the Scout SDK that is available for the Eclipse IDE.

The Scout Tooling provides wizards to create new project and application components, adds code assistance to the Java Editor and comes with a NLS editor to manage all translated text entries of the application.
