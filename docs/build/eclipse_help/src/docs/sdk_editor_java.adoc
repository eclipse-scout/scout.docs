Scout uses the standard Java Editor of the Eclipse IDE.
To ease the development, the Scout SDK provides additional features for the Java Editor.

To create new Scout Elements, content assist offers Scout specific propsals. 
The Eclipse content assist can be started by typing kbd:[Ctrl,Space]. 
Depending on the location of the current position in the Java editor context specific Scout propoals are added that trigger the creation of inner classes for form fields, table columns or codes.

==== Create new Form Fields
To add additional form fields to a form the current edit position needs to be inside of a Scout group box. 
Typing kbd:[Ctrl,Space] then provides access to the most frequently used Scout widgets as shown in <<img-java_proposals_groupbox>>.

When a template is selected, it is possible to customized it by navigating between the different Edit-Groups with the kbd:[Tab] Key (this works exactly like other templates in the Eclipse Editor).
With this mechanism you can quickly define the class name, the parent class and other properties.
To exit the Edit-Mode just press kbd:[Enter].

==== Create new Table Columns
For adding new columns in a table the set the current edit position inside a Scout table. 
The Scout table itself may be located inside of a TableField as shown in <<img-java_proposals_table>> or can also be located inside of a Scout TablePage.

Next to adding columns the content assist shown in <<img-java_proposals_table>> can also be used to add key stroke actions and menus to tables.

==== Create new Codes
Adding new Codes to an existing CodeType is supported by the content assist as shown in <<img-java_proposals_code>>.

==== NLS-Entry support

When the the current edit position is inside the String parameter of the `TEXTS.get()` code, the content assist provide support for the NLS entries.
<<img-java_proposals_texts>> provides an example.

[[img-java_proposals_texts, Figure Proposals in a TEXTS.get()]]
.Proposals corresponding to NLS Support.

You can select one of the matching entries (like "DateOfBirth" in the example) and you will see the different translations on the right.

You can select "New text..." to open the <<sdk_wizard_nls-entry.adoc#, NLS Entry Wizard>>.

==== Scout Tooling
Go back to the <<sdk.adoc#, Scout Tooling>>.
