With this tutorial you will learn how to import the Scout Demo applications into your workspace.
The tutorial consists of the following two parts:

* Install the Scout Demo applications
* Run the Scout demo from your IDE

==== Install the Scout Demo Applications

In the first part of the tutorial we import the demo applications using the https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer[Oomph Eclipse installer,window=_blank] tool.

In the Eclipse IDE open the [wizard]_Import_ wizard with menu menu:File[Import...].
This opens the dialog shown in <<img-oomph_existing_project>>.
Next, under folder [folder]_Oomph_ select the node [folder]_Projects into Workspace_ and click the btn:[Next] button.

Now select Scout Demo App, check in the table below that 'Stream' shows the desired Scout version and click btn:[Next].

On the next wizard page, select the _Show all variables_ check box in the bottom left corner.

Before you proceed make sure that all shown variables are set appropriately for your use case.

* `Git clone location rule`: "`Located in a folder named '.git/{lt}repo{gt}' within the workspace folder`"
* `Target Platform`: "`None`"
* `JRE 11 Location`: Path to your Java 11 JRE
* `Scout Demo App Github repository`: "`HTTPS (read-only, anonymous)`"

Once you finished setting the variables click btn:[Next].
This leads to the [wizard]_Confirmation_ dialog.
This last step can be completed by clicking on btn:[Finish].

The Oomph installer first makes sure that all necessary Scout components and M2E connectors are available.
In case one or more components are missing, Oomph will first download and install them.
This triggers a restart request as shown in <<img-oomph_restart>>.
If the dialog does not automatically appear, click on the small icon in the status bar on the bottom as shown in <<img-oomph_status>>.

To complete the installation click btn:[Finish].
If your IDE needs to be restarted, select the same workspace in the [wizard]_Eclipse Launcher_ dialog.

After the restart Oomph will continue to download and install the Scout demo applications showing the progress in the Eclipse importer dialog.
Once the download and installation has completed you can close the dialog with clicking the btn:[Finish] button.

===== Setup result

After the Setup of the "Scout Demo App", a lot of projects are materialized in the workspace (see the screenshot in <<img-oomph_workingsets>>).
The projects are organized in three working sets:

Demo App: Contacts:: The projects corresponding to the Scout Demo Application "Contacts".
Demo App: Widgets:: The projects corresponding to the Scout Demo Applications "Widgets" and "JSWidgets".
Demo Docs:: The scout documentation and the project containing most of the code snippets included in the documentation.

If you do not see the workingsets, you might need to select "menu:Top Level Elements[Working Sets]" from the Menu as displayed in <<img-workingsets_top_level>>

[[img-workingsets_top_level]]
.Select "Working Sets" as "Top Level Elements" in the "Package Explorer".

==== Run the Contacts Demo Application

With the Scout demo installed in our workspace we are now ready to start the applications from within our IDE.

===== Start the application in the IDE

Open the [menu]_Run As_ menu as shown in <<img-oomph_run_contacts_all>>.
There are 3 launch groups available, one for each application.
Each launch group will start all the necessary builds and servers.
Now select _[contacts] all_ (Windows or Unix variant) to run the Contacts application.

[[img-oomph_run_contacts_all]]
.Start the Contacts application.

Once the startup sequence of the Contacts application has completed the console view in your Eclipse IDE should look like <<img-oomph_contacts_console>>.

===== Use the Contacts Demo in a Browser

With the Contacts demo running in the IDE open the application in your favorite browser via URL http://localhost:8082[http://localhost:8082,window=_blank].
To get the screen shown in <<img-contacts_persons_alice>> first click on the [folder]_Persons_ node and then double click on the ''Alice'' row.

==== What's Next?

Play with the Contacts application.
This provides a good overview of a typical Scout application.
You can browse through the data, open different forms and add/change entities.

Also have a quick look at the code.
The list on the left side of the application containing the nodes [folder]_Persons_ and [folder]_Organizations_ is implemented in class [java]+ContactOutline+ as shown in <<lst-contacts_outline>>.

[[lst-contacts_outline]]

.ContactOutline implementation.
----
include::{codedir}/contacts/org.eclipse.scout.contacts.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/contacts/client/contact/ContactOutline.java[tags=Outline]
----

If you have clicked on the [folder]_Persons_ node a page with all available persons is shown.
This page is implemented in class [java]+PersonTablePage+ and the dialog to show/edit persons is implemented in class [java]+PersonForm+.

This is the end of the <<tutorial.adoc#getting-started, getting started>> guide.
