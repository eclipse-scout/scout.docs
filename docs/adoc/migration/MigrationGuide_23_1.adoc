Usage example in your package.json:

[source,json]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]

----

The pre-built Scout JavaScript assets are also available using a CDN (e.g. to be directly included in a html document):
https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@eclipse-scout/core?path=dist

=== IDE Tooling (Scout SDK)

Scout officially supports https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] and {scout-sdk-download-link}.

==== IntelliJ IDEA

You can download the Scout plugin for IntelliJ IDEA from the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13393-eclipse-scout/[JetBrains Plugin Repository] or you can use the plugins client built into IntelliJ IDEA.
Please refer to the https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html[IntelliJ Help] on how to install and manage plugins.

==== Eclipse

You can download the complete Eclipse IDE with Scout SDK included here: +
{scout-sdk-download-link}

To install the Scout SDK into your existing Eclipse IDE, use this P2 update site: +
{scout-sdk-update-site}

== ObjectType as Class Reference (Scout JS)

As described in the {release-notes-link}, it is now possible to use class references for the `objectType`.
Even though the string based style still works and a migration is not necessary, the class reference style is the preferred way for the future.

If you would like to migrate your code, here is how we did it (we used IntelliJ for the process).

. Find and replace all occurrences of `scout.create()`, `objectType:` and `lookupCall:` (use Ctrl-Shift-R in IntelliJ and enable Regex).
+
[source]
----
Find: scout.create\('(.*\.)?(.*)'
Replace: scout.create\($2
----
+
[source]
----
Find: objectType: '(.*\.)?(.*)'
Replace: objectType: $2
----
+
[source]
----
Find: lookupCall: '(.*\.)?(.*)'
Replace: lookupCall: $2
----

The regex considers objectTypes with and without namespace.

. Add imports  +
Now we need to add the required imports.
You can either manually add them, but with a lot of files it is a tedious task.
Unfortunately, IntelliJ does not provide a possibility to automatically add all missing imports.
But there is a trick: resolve multiple inspections at once using code analysis.

.. Start the action `Run inspection by name` and select the inspection `Unresolved JavaScript variable`.
+
.Start Action
image::{mgimgsdir}/unresolved-variable-inspection.png[]
.Select inspection
image::{mgimgsdir}/unresolved-variable-inspection-1.png[]
.. Select `Uncommitted files` and disable all inspection options, because the inspection is not limited to missing imports.
Click OK to run the analysis.
+
.Run Action
image::{mgimgsdir}/unresolved-variable-inspection-2.png[]

.. In the result view, select one or more problems and click the button `Missing import statement`.
+
Note: Sometimes `Missing import statement` is located in a drop down called `Apply quick fixes to all the problems`.
+
Note: Even though we disabled all inspection options, there may still be problems other than `Missing import statement`.
If that is the case, resolving multiple problems is not possible unless you unselect these problems including theirs parent node.
+
.Resolve problems
image::{mgimgsdir}/unresolved-variable-inspection-3.png[]
.Button in drop down
image::{mgimgsdir}/unresolved-variable-inspection-3a.png[]

.. Finally, you need to verify, whether the imports are correct.
Please make sure all imports are present for every object type and the classes are imported from a module and not a single file.
+
.Good import
[source,js]
----
import {Button, GroupBox} from '@eclipse-scout/core';
----
+
.Bad import
[source,js]
----
import Button from '@eclipse-scout/core/src/form/fields/button/Button.js';
----

== options-parameter for filter-methods in menus.js (Scout JS)

The methods `filter` and `filterAccordingToSelection` in `menus.js` now have an options-parameter. This parameter combines the former parameters `onlyVisible`, `enableDisableKeyStrokes` and `notAllowedTypes`.
The following are two migration examples:

.Old
[source,js]
----
let allowedTypes = ['Example.MenuType'],
  onlyVisible = true,
  enableDisableKeyStrokes = false;

// example 1
menus.filter(this.menus, allowedTypes, true, false);

// example 2
menus.filter(this.menus, allowedTypes, onlyVisible, enableDisableKeyStrokes);

----

.New
[source,js]
----
let allowedTypes = ['Example.MenuType'],
  onlyVisible = true,
  enableDisableKeyStrokes = false;

// example 1
menus.filter(this.menus, allowedTypes, {
  onlyVisible: true,
  enableDisableKeyStrokes: false
});

// example 2
menus.filter(this.menus, allowedTypes, {onlyVisible, enableDisableKeyStrokes});

== IId types, IdFactory and IdExternalFormatter

Up to release 2022 the support for typed identifiers (IId) was limited to root ids wrapping one specific Java identifier.
The support was extended to include composite ids wrapping multiple java identifiers.
As part of this new feature a refactoring of the existing id classes was done which may require some migration steps:

* `IId` was typed with a generic parameter `<WRAPPED_TYPE>` which was removed and moved to `AbstractRootId`. If you need this generic parameter, change your code to use `AbstractRootId` instead of `IId` or consider removing the generic parameter at interface-level in your code as well.
* `IId` up to release 2022 were limited to wrap a single value. If your code rely on a single wrapped value, replace `IId` by `IRootId` and `AbstractId` by `AbstractRootId`. If you don't change your code type and use `IId` you implicitly add support for composite types in your APIs.
* Some factory methods for building ids and serialization where moved between classes and/or renamed (the serialized string representation is identical):
** `IdExternalFormatter.getTypeName()` -> `IdInventory.getTypeName()`
** `IdExternalFormatter.getIdClass()` -> `IdInventory.getIdClass()`
** `IdExternalFormatter.toExternalForm()` -> `IdCodec.toQualified()`
** `IdExternalFormatter.fromExternalForm()` -> `IdCodec.fromQualified()`
** `IdExternalFormatter.fromExternalFormLenient()` -> `IdCodec.fromQualifiedLenient()`
** `IId.unwrapAsString()` -> `IdCodec.toUnqualified()` (Note: Unwrap as string is still available for `IRootId` but according to the javadoc should only be used for logging and debugging purpose)
** `IdFactory.createFromString()` -> `IdCodec.fromUnqualified()`
* Completeness test for ids was improved. Use `AbstractIdStructureTest` as base for id completeness tests in own maven modules.
** Implementations of `AbstractStringId` are required to create a null-id instance if invoked with an empty string (e.g. use `if (StringUtility.isNullOrEmpty(id)) { return null; }` in your static `of()` method, see `FixtureStringId` as example)
** The former base classes `AbstractUuIdStructureTest` and `AbstractStringIdStructureTest` were integrated and removed
