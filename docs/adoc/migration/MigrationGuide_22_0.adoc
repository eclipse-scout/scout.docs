== About This Document

This document describes all relevant changes *from Eclipse Scout {scout-previous-version} to Eclipse Scout {scout-version}*. If existing code has to be migrated, instructions are provided here.

== Obtaining the Latest Version

=== Scout Runtime for Java

Scout Runtime artifacts for Java are distributed using Maven Central:

* {maven-central-link} on _Maven Central_
* {mvnrepository-link} on _mvnrepository.com_

Usage example in the parent POM of your Scout application:

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.scout.rt</groupId>
    <artifactId>org.eclipse.scout.rt</artifactId>
    <version>{maven-version}</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
----

=== Scout Runtime for JavaScript

Scout Runtime artifacts for JavaScript are distributed using npm:

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-scout/core[Scout Core Runtime]
* https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40eclipse-scout[All official Scout JavaScript packages]

Usage example in your package.json:

[source,json]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{
  "name": "my-module",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@eclipse-scout/cli": "{node-version}",
    "@eclipse-scout/releng": "^22.0.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@eclipse-scout/core": "{node-version}",
    "jquery": "3.6.0"
  }
}
----

The pre-built Scout JavaScript assets are also available using a CDN (e.g. to be directly included in a html document):
https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@eclipse-scout/core?path=dist

=== IDE Tooling (Scout SDK)

Scout officially supports https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] and {scout-sdk-download-link}.

==== IntelliJ IDEA

You can download the Scout plugin for IntelliJ IDEA from the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13393-eclipse-scout/[JetBrains Plugin Repository] or you can use the plugins client built into IntelliJ IDEA.
Please refer to the https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html[IntelliJ Help] on how to install and manage plugins.

==== Eclipse

You can download the complete Eclipse IDE with Scout SDK included here: +
{scout-sdk-download-link}

To install the Scout SDK into your existing Eclipse IDE, use this P2 update site: +
{scout-sdk-update-site}

== New 3rd Party requirements

The Java 8 support has been dropped in Scout 22.
Scout 22 older than 22.0.11 only supports Java 11.
Scout 22.0.11 or newer supports Java 17 too. Check the chapter <<Migrating to Java 17>> if you plan to use Java 17.
You can get a Java 11 or 17 runtime from https://adoptium.net/[the Adoptium page].

Ensure you have at least Maven 3.6.3 installed. Older versions are no longer supported.
You can get a new Maven runtime at https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[the Maven download site].

Ensure you have at least Node 16.13.0 installed. Older versions will not work.
A new version can be obtained from https://nodejs.org/en/download/[the Node download page].

Scout now requires at least pnpm 6.22.2. You can install it as described on the https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm[pnpm installation page].

To update your application the following steps might be required:

* Update the version of the `maven_rt_plugin_config-master` in your `pom.xml` files to the newest `22.0.x` release. See https://search.maven.org/classic/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.eclipse.scout%22%20AND%20a%3A%22maven_rt_plugin_config-master%22[Maven central] for a list of versions available.
* Update the Scout versions (`package.json` and `pom.xml`) as shown in <<Obtaining the Latest Version>>.
* In case you have set one of the following properties in your `pom.xml` files, update its value to `11` or `17` (depending on the Java version you want to use):
** `jdk.source.version`
** `jdk.min.version`
** `maven.compiler.source`
** `maven.compiler.target`
** `maven.compiler.release`
* In case you used the `cargo-maven2-plugin` replace it with the `cargo-maven3-plugin`.
* If you are using Eclipse and web-service providers, update the `.factorypath` files as shown in the `JAX-WS Appendix` of the Scout documentation.
* The support for Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge Legacy has been dropped.
Accordingly, you might want to update the list with supported browsers in your `unsupported-browser.html` file (if existing). Remove the list item having text `ui.BrowserInternetExplorer`.
You can keep the one with Edge, because the new Chromium based Microsoft Edge browser is supported.

=== Migrating to Java 17

If you are using Scout 22.0.11 or newer you may upgrade to Java 17.
For this you have to do the following steps:

. Update the `jdk.source.version` property in the `pom.xml` of your parent module to `17`.
. Regenerate all your private-public-key pairs. The values are stored in the config properties `scout.auth.privateKey` and `scout.auth.publicKey`.

+
To create a new key pair you can execute the class `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.security.SecurityUtility` on the command line. This will print a new, unique, Java 17 compatible key pair.

+
Afterwards update the properties with the new values. It is recommended to have different values for each environment!

+
While the new key pair is necessary if using Java 17, it is optional if you stay on Java 11.
But still you may create new pairs even if you would like stay with Java 11 for now.
Then the keys are already Java 17 compatible and must not be changed again when actually upgrading to Java 17.

. Furthermore, ensure you have at least version 22.0.2 of the `maven_rt_plugin_config-master` in your `pom.xml` files. See https://search.maven.org/classic/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.eclipse.scout%22%20AND%20a%3A%22maven_rt_plugin_config-master%22[Maven central] for a list of versions available.

=== Update of 3rd Party library _chart.js_ to 3.7.0

If you are using the charts from `@eclipse-scout/chart` you might need to update the config object of your charts, as most of them are rendered using _chart.js_.

First check this  https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/v3-migration.html[migration guide].
In addition, the following config attributes must also be migrated:

* `config.options.scales.minSpaceBetweenXTicks` -> `config.options.scales.x.minSpaceBetweenTicks`
* `config.options.scales.minSpaceBetweenYTicks` -> `config.options.scales.y.minSpaceBetweenTicks`
* `config.options.scale.minSpaceBetweenTicks` -> `config.options.scales.r.minSpaceBetweenTicks`
* `config.options.scales.[id].afterCalculateTickRotation` -> `config.options.scales.[id].afterCalculateLabelRotation`
* `...fontColor` -> `...color`
* `...fontFamily` -> `...font.family`
* `...fontSize` -> `...font.size`
* `...fontStyle` -> `...font.style`
* `config.bubble` -> `config.options.bubble`
* `config.fulfillment` -> `config.options.fulfillment`
* `config.salesfunnel` -> `config.options.salesfunnel`
* `config.speedo` -> `config.options.speedo`
* `config.venn` -> `config.options.venn`
* `config.data.datasets[i].pointHoverBackgroundColor` only for `config.type` _line_ and _radar_ or `config.data.dataset[i].type` _line_
* `config.data.datasets[i].pointBorderColor` only for `config.type` _line_ and _radar_ or `config.data.dataset[i].type` _line_
* `config.data.datasets[i].pointHoverBorderColor` only for `config.type` _line_ and _radar_ or `config.data.dataset[i].type` _line_

Also, we observed some changes that might be of interest:

* Remove the `borderWidth` on every _dataset_ when `backgroundColor` and `borderColor` are the same. Otherwise, there will be a small white line between the border and the background.
* `Scale.longestLabelWidth` -> `Scale._labelSizes.widest.width`
* `Scale._ticks` -> `Scale.ticks`
* `Element._datasetIndex` -> `Element.datasetIndex`
* `Element._index` -> `Element.index`
* Never use `data.splice(n)`, always use `data.splice(n, data.length - n)`, as _chart.js_ listens on splice-events and can't handle calls without the `deleteCount`.

The _chart.js_ tooltip was replaced by the scout tooltip. Therefore, the css class `.tooltip-background` ca be removed.

=== Update of other 3rd Party JavaScript libraries

Perform the following migration in all your `package.json` files:

* If you specify the minimum engines versions please update them as follows:
+
[source,json lines]
----
"engines": {
    "node": ">=16.13.0",
    "npm": ">=8.1.0",
    "pnpm": ">=6.22.2"
}
----
* Update the following dependencies (if existing in your application):
+
[source,json lines]
----
"jquery": "3.6.0"
"jasmine-core": "3.10.1"
"karma": "6.3.9"
"eslint": "8.10.0"

----
* Replace dependencies to `babel-eslint` and `eslint-plugin-babel` with these two:
+
[source,json lines]
----
"@babel/eslint-parser": "7.16.5",
"@babel/eslint-plugin": "7.16.5"
----
* Adjust your .eslintrc.js in the following way:
+
[source,json lines]
----
  plugins: ['@babel'],
  parser: '@babel/eslint-parser',
  parserOptions: {
    requireConfigFile: false
  }
----

== Eclipse Launch Group

If your launch group contains an action that waits for a specific console output before starting the ui and backend servers, you probably need to adjust the regular expression.
Otherwise, the launch is likely to get stuck at about 63%.

To do so, edit your launch configuration and change the regular expression of the `js build` program from `Built at:` to `compiled .*successfully`.
Or remove the action completely if you prefer the launchers to be started in parallel.

.Adjust Launch Group
image::{mgimgsdir}/launch-group.png[]

== Release engineering changes

The following changes have been made to the Scout releng. Please apply the necessary migration steps in your files and build scripts (may also affect continuous integration environments):

* If you have a `.npmrc` file (locally in your project root and/or your user home or on your build infrastructure), update it to the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# pnpm settings
shared-workspace-lockfile=true
link-workspace-packages=true
prefer-workspace-packages=true

# npm settings
engine-strict=true
scripts-prepend-node-path=auto
----

The property `prefer-workspace-packages` is new and important if you have multiple npm modules in your project.

* In all your `package.json` files:
** Replace `"snapshot-cleanup": "releng-scripts snapshot-cleanup"` with `"cleanup:snapshots": "releng-scripts cleanup:snapshots"`
** Replace `"snapshot-predependency": "releng-scripts snapshot-install-dependency"` with `"version:snapshot:dependencies": "releng-scripts version:snapshot:dependencies"`
** Replace `"snapshot-postdependency": "releng-scripts snapshot-publish-dependency"` with `"version:snapshot": "releng-scripts version:snapshot"`
** Replace `"release-predependency": "releng-scripts release-install-dependency"` with `"version:release:dependencies": "releng-scripts version:release:dependencies"`
** Replace `"release-postdependency": "releng-scripts release-publish-dependency"` with `"version:release": "releng-scripts version:release"`
** If you are executing the npm scripts above during your build, update the names in your build scripts accordingly.
** If you are using snapshot dependencies of the form `"x.y.z-snapshot"` replace it with a range version of the form `">=x.y.z-snapshot <x.y.z"`
* In all your `pom.xml` files (and probably in your build scripts):
** Rename Maven property `master_skip_snapshot_predependency` to `master_skip_npm_version_snapshot_dependencies`
** Rename Maven property `master_skip_snapshot_postdependency` to `master_skip_npm_version_snapshot`
** Rename Maven property `master_skip_release_predependency` to `master_skip_npm_version_release_dependencies`
** Rename Maven property `master_skip_release_postdependency` to `master_skip_npm_version_release`
** Rename Maven profile `npm-snapshot-predependency` to `npm-version-snapshot-dependencies`
** Rename Maven profile `npm-snapshot-postdependency` to `npm-version-snapshot`
** Rename Maven profile `npm-release-predependency` to `npm-version-release-dependencies`
** Rename Maven profile `npm-release-postdependency` to `npm-version-release`
* In the past the profile `npm-snapshot-postdependency` (now called `npm-version-snapshot` se above) was executed automatically. This profile generates unique snapshot versions having a timestamp for your `package.json` files so that they may be deployed to a npm repository. This profile is no longer active by default so that your source code is not changed when executing a simple maven build. Therefore, if your `package.json` files have versions (own version, not dependency version) with a `-snapshot` suffix and you deploy such snapshots to a npm repository after a build, you have to manually add the profile `npm-version-snapshot` to that build now.

== Log4j support removed

The Support for https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/[Log4j] logging has been dropped as Log4j 1 is end-of-life.
If you still rely on Log4j 1 please update to another logger implementation.
Scout supports java.util.Logging and http://logback.qos.ch/[Logback] (recommended) out of the box but other SLF4j compatible loggers can be configured as well.

== @TypeVersion Annotation Type Change

The type version of a data object is used to identify a certain structure version of the stored data object.
A data object may be stored in a database or be available as a container to export certain data for import in a different compatible system.
Such a data object may evolve over time and undergo structural changes.
Some structural changes make it necessary to apply migrations to existing serialized data objects to comply with the new structure.

In order to prepare for migration support, the value type of the `@TypeVersion` annotation was changed from `String` to `Class<? extends ITypeVersion>`.
A _ITypeVersion_ represents a namespace/version and its dependencies.

*Migration:*

For each different String value used in type version annotation, create an implementation of `ITypeVersion` as described
in link:{techdoc}#cha-namespace-and-itypeversion[Data Objects: Namespace and ITypeVersion] in the technical documentation.

`DataObjectInventory#getTypeVersion` now returns `NamespaceVersion` instead of `String`.
Use `NamespaceVersion#unwrap` to access the text representation.

== Annotation @EnumVersion Removed

`@EnumVersion` was designed for migration support similar as the TypeVersion but was never part of any serialization output of a data object,
therefore couldn't be used as indicator for migrations.
Support for `@EnumVersion` was removed.

*Migration:*

Remove `@EnumVersion` annotations on `IEnum` implementors.

== Native Notification Support

The new notifications displayed by the browser use the application logo configured in `AbstractDesktop#getConfiguredLogoId()` by default.

If you use native notifications, you should provide a logo with a resolution of at least 150x150 px.
If your application logo already has such a resolution, it should be fine.
If your application logo has a lower resolution or is an SVG, you should use a different image for the notifications (SVGs are not supported by Chrome notifications).
To do so, just configure the native notification defaults on your desktop.

[source,java]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
@Override
protected NativeNotificationDefaults getConfiguredNativeNotificationDefaults() {
  return super.getConfiguredNativeNotificationDefaults()
    .withIconId("notification_logo.png");
}
----

== Application Logo / Info Form

The image `application_logo_large` and the constant `AbstractIcons.ApplicationLogo` have been removed.
The name was confusing and it was only used for the `ScoutInfoForm`.
The info form now uses the logo of the desktop (`IDesktop#getLogoId())` by default.
So if you prefer to use a different logo for the info form, just extend the info form, override the method `getProductLogo()` and return the name of your preferred image.

In case you don't use SVG logos yet, you should consider doing so to prevent blurry logos.

== Style

=== LESS Variables

Many less variables have been modified, added and removed.
Also, the name "active" has been replaced with selected where it has been used for a selection state rather than the css "active" state (mouse press).

Following renames have been applied (incomplete list):

- @active-inverted-background-color -> @selected-background-color
- @active-inverted-color -> @selected-color
- @command-button-active-* -> @command-button-selected-*
- @default-button-active-background-color -> @default-button-selected-background-color
- @navigation-background-color -> @desktop-navigation-background-color
- @navigation-color -> @desktop-navigation-color
- @outline-title-margin-left/right -> @outline-title-padding-left/right
- @group-box-title-margin-top -> @group-box-header-margin-top
- @group-box-title-border-width -> @group-box-header-border-width
- @simple-tab-active-\*background -> @simple-tab-selected-*
- @wizard-step-active-* -> @wizard-step-selected-*

Notes:
@desktop-navigation-background-color now points to @desktop-header-background-color;
Instead of customizing the navigation background color it is suggested to now customize the header background color.

=== CSS Rules

Many css rules have been adjusted for the new style.
So if you have customized some Scout components, please check your rules if they are still doing what they are supposed to.

The following list shows some of the changes:

- .menubox -> .menubar-box
- .group-box-title -> .group-box-header > .title
- border-bottom of group-box-title -> .group-box-header > .bottom-border
- .tab-box-bottom-border -> .bottom-border
- Tree/Table: Selection style is not applied to the table-row/tree-node anymore but to a separate ::after element
- Button/Menu: simplified CSS and HTML structure

For details please see the individual commits.

=== Icons

==== Cleanup

Some icons have been removed because they are not used by Scout itself anymore.
If you need these icons, please add them to your own icon library.
If you don't already have a custom icon library, please see our guide on how to create one:
https://eclipsescout.github.io/11.0/technical-guide.html#icons
The icons from Scout can be found here: https://github.com/eclipse-scout/scout.rt/tree/releases/11.0/org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/icons
There you also find a `selection.json` that can be used to import the icons to https://icomoon.io/app[IcoMoon].

- MENU_BOLD (uF0C9)
- LIST_UL_BOLD (uF0CA)
- LIST_OL_BOLD (uF0CB)
- ROTATE_LEFT_BOLD (F0E2)
- ROTATE_RIGHT_BOLD (F01E)
- GRAPH_BOLD (uE023)
- CATEGORY (uE059)
- CATEGORY_BOLD (uE024)
- ELLIPSIS-V-BOLD / VERTICAL_DOTS (uE040)
- SPINNER (uE044)
- ANGLE-DOUBLE-LEFT-BOLD (uF100)
- ANGLE-DOUBLE-RIGHT-BOLD (uF101)
- ANGLE-DOUBLE-UP-BOLD (uF102)
- ANGLE-DOUBLE-DOWN-BOLD (uF103)
- BOLD (uE051)
- ITALIC (uE052)
- UNDERLINE (uE053)
- STRIKETHROUGH (uE054)
- LIST-UL (uE055)
- LIST-OL (uE056)
- LIGHTBULB_OFF (uE057)
- LIGHTBULB_ON (uE058)

The following icons have been renamed
- EXCLAMATION_MARK -> EXCLAMATION_MARK_BOLD

==== Line Width Adjustments

The line width of the Scout icons has been increased a little because they are now displayed a little smaller.
If you use custom icons in combination with the Scout icons, you may want to consider adjusting the line widths of your icons as well.
This should only be relevant if you explicitly used the Scout icons in your code.

Also, the Scout icons now come with a regular and a light font.
The regular font should be used if the icon is displayed at about 16px.
This is the case for most widgets (menu, button etc.)
If the icon is displayed larger, the light font can be used.
To activate it for your custom widget, set the font-weight to @icon-font-weight-light.

If you want to align your custom icons with the Scout icons, use the following dimensions:

* Regular: 1.5px line width and 24px artboard height
* Light: 1px line width and 24px artboard height

== Form

Views (forms with display hint = view) are now closable by default.
Until now, only dialogs containing a close or cancel button showed the close icon in the top right corner.
If you have views that must not be closable, set closable to false explicitly.

== Browser Field

The type of the `data` argument for the callback `execPostMessage` was changed from _String_ to _Object_.
This allows for the widest variety of data that can be sent from an embedded page to the application:

* String
* Number
* Boolean
* IDataObject (objects or arrays)

In previous Scout versions, all messages were always converted to text.
Now, the data type is preserved as accurately as possible.
JSON objects or arrays are converted to IDoEntity or DoList with the help of the IObjectMapper bean.
To use this feature, an implementation of IDataObjectMapper needs to be present at runtime.
If no implementation is available, the data will be converted to text automatically.

*Migration:*

Adjust the signature of all implementations of `AbstractBrowserField#postMessage` in your code.

* Change `execPostMessage(String data, String origin)` to `execPostMessage(Object data, String origin)`.
* If the message sent by the embedded web page is not a text, the appropriate data type is now passed.
Check the expected type using `instanceof` or convert it to String manually.
* If you want objects and arrays to be converted to IDataObjects automatically, make sure there is an
implementation of IObjectMapper present at runtime, e.g. by adding a dependency to the module
_org.eclipse.scout.rt.jackson_ in pom.xml.

== Lazy Creation of detailTable and detailForm in Scout JS Pages

In the past when a page was created the embedded detail forms and tables have been created together with the page.
This may lead to a bad performance when an outline containing lots of complex pages is created.

Therefore the containing tables and forms are now only created when the page is activated (e.g. selected by the user).
This is the same behavior as already implemented in Scout Classic since several years.
As a consequence accessing `Page.detailForm` or `Page.detailTable` may now return `null` if the page has not been activated yet.

Check all usages of the `detailForm` and `detailTable` properties of pages in your code and ensure it is guarded with a null check or is only executed when the page has already been activated.

Typically these properties are accessed in the `_init()` function of a page e.g. to attach listeners.
This is no longer possible as these properties are no longer available at that moment.

As an alternative override the `_initDetailForm(form)` or `_initDetailTable(table)` methods if your code exists on a Page (don't forget to add a super call).
If outside a Page listen for the `propertyChange` events for `detailForm` or `detailTable` to execute your detailForm or detailTable dependant code.

Furthermore if you use the following methods on pages, please rename them as follows:

* from `createDetailForm` to `_createDetailForm`
* from `_createTable` to `_createDetailTable`
* from `_initTable` to `_initDetailTable`
* from `_ensureDetailForm` to `ensureDetailForm`

== TagField (Scout JS)

The tag field is not clickable by default anymore.
If you need the tags to be clickable (and triggering a tagClick event), you have to activate it manually by setting `clickable` to true in the given tag field model.
Or by using the dedicated setter: `tagField.tagBar.setClickable(true)`.

== Jackson DoEntity Deserializer

The following classes were renamed:

* IDoEntityDeserializerTypeResolver -> IDoEntityDeserializerTypeStrategy
* DefaultDoEntityDeserializerTypeResolver -> DefaultDoEntityDeserializerTypeStrategy
* RawDoEntityDeserializerTypeResolver -> RawDoEntityDeserializerTypeStrategy

== Json raw deserialization of floating point numbers

When raw deserializing json using Jackson (e.g. by using `JacksonDataObjectMapper#readValueRaw`) the behavior changed for floating point numbers:
In former releases float numbers fitting into a `Double` have been mapped to `Double`. Now always a `BigDecimal` is used.
This helps to clarify and stabilize the API (the datatype does not suddenly change if the numbers get bigger) and it helps to map the value from the json to a more precise Java representation (a `Double` cannot hold all floats exactly).

Nothing changes if you deserialize json to a typed DataObject. Then the target type of the attribute in the DataObject is used.

If your code relies on a specific float type after raw deserialization, update it accordingly to handle `BigDecimal` instead.

== Data Objects without @TypeName Annotation

The behavior of data objects without a `@TypeName` annotation was changed.
In former releases such a data object was serialized into JSON including a `"_type" : null` type name.
The new implementation does not include the null-TypeName in the serialized JSON document.

== Deprecated Functions in strings.js Utility

The static `strings` utility provides various string-related functions.
The obsolete functions `uppercaseFirstLetter` and `lowercaseFirstLetter` were deprecated in favor of more robust and consistent alternatives, and should no longer be used.
They will be removed eventually.

*Migration:*

* Change `strings.uppercaseFirstLetter(s)` to `strings.toUpperCaseFirstLetter(s)`.
* Change `strings.lowercaseFirstLetter(s)` to `strings.toLowerCaseFirstLetter(s)`.

Note the uppercase "C" in the new function names!

TIP: At the same time, some new null-safe variants of `String` prototype methods were added: `toUpperCase(s)`, `toLowerCase(s)`, `length(s)`, `trim(s)` .

== Removed functions in StreamUtility.java

The `StreamUtility` utility provided some methods that were functionally identical to Java 9 methods of the same name.
The methods `not`, `takeWhile`, and `iterate` were removed; the equivalent Java core library methods may now be used directly.

*Migration:*

* Change `StreamUtility.not(p)` to `java.util.function.Predicate.not(p)`.
* Change `StreamUtility.takeWhile(stream, predicate)` to `stream.takeWhile(predicate)`.
* Change `StreamUtility.iterate(initialElement, hasNext, next)` to `java.util.stream.Stream.iterate(initialElement, hasNext, next)`.

Note that `takeWhile` now operates on the `java.util.Stream` object itself and no longer is a static method.

== New Style for Tooltips

The style and colors for tooltips has been changed which may require the following migration:

. The colors for tooltips have changed: severity `OK` is showing in green, `INFO` in black and `WARNING` in orange. Severity `ERROR` is still red and therefore remains unchanged. If you use a `Status` that is displayed as tooltip and uses one of the changed severities, verify if the color matches the meaning of the tooltip and adapt the severity if necessary.
. Scout JS only: The tooltips are now displayed in inverse style (white text, dark background). If you used custom styling for your tooltips (using property `htmlEnabled`), you might require to adapt your styles to look nice again with the inverse style.

== Logging the HTTP Session ID

The HTTP Session ID is a crucial factor of a web application's security.
Knowledge of the session ID can enable attackers to hijack the session of an active user.
It must therefore not be made available to a malicious third party under any circumstances!
Writing the ID to a log files _might_ therefore pose a security risk, depending on who has access to the file.

Scout does not directly output the HTTP Session ID by default, but it provides a corresponding "diagnostics context value" (http://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/slf4j/MDC.html[MDC]).
If the logger implementation is configured accordingly, the context value `http.session.id` is written to the log file.

In accordance with the _security by default_ principle, the diagnostics context value no longer contains the full session ID.
Instead, an obfuscated and truncated identifier is provided.
It cannot be converted back to the original session ID but is still sufficiently unique to relate log entries for the same session for debugging purposes.
See the class `HttpSessionIdLogHelper` for details.

*Migration:*

* No migration is required.
* Logger configurations that don't use the MDC value `http.session.id` are not affected by this change.
* The content of the MDC value `http.session.id` can be configured via the system property _scout.diagnostics.httpSessionIdLogMode_.
** `SHORT`: Provides a safe, truncated session identifier. This is the default value (no configuration required).
** `OFF`: Never provides a value (always empty).
** `FULL`: Provides the full HTTP Session ID. This restores the previous, less safe behavior. *Using this value is NOT recommended!*

== ScoutFieldStatus deleted

The class `ScoutFieldStatus` has been deleted. It can be replaced with `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.status.Status`.

== New Filter API for ScoutJS

The widgets `Table.js`, `Tree.js`, `TileGrid.js` and `TileAccordion.js` share a common filter API since 22.0.
This API contains the methods `addFilter(filter, applyFilter = true)`, `removeFilter(filter, applyFilter = true)` and `setFilters(filters, applyFilter = true)` and the property `filters`.

The corresponding methods of the `TileAccordion.js` used to be `addTileFilter(filter)`, `removeTileFilter(filter)` and `setTileFilters(filters)`. These methods were renamed to the ones above.
The property `tileFilters` was renamed to `filters` as well.

Some of the above widgets also had `addFilters` and `removeFilters` methods to add or remove an array of filters. Those methods were removed as the new ones can handle single filters and arrays of filters.

The mentioned widgets used to have a different behavior whether after modifying the filters they were executed or not. All calls need to be checked and adjusted accordingly.

Examples:

.add a filter to `tree` and do not apply the filters, execute some other logic and then apply the filters
[source,js]
----
tree.addFilter(filter, false);
// some other logic here
tree.filter();
----

.remove multiple filters from `table` and apply the filters
[source,js]
----
table.removeFilter(filters);
----

*Migration:*

* `Table.js`:
** Change `addFilter(filter);` to `addFilter(filter, false);` and `addFilter(filter); filter();` to `addFilter(filter);`
** Change `removeFilter(filter);` to `removeFilter(filter, false);` and `removeFilter(filter); filter();` to `removeFilter(filter);`
** Change `removeFilterByKey(filter);` to `removeFilterByKey(filter, false);` and `removeFilterByKey(filter); filter();` to `removeFilterByKey(filter);`
** Change `setFilters(filters);` to `setFilters(filters, false);` and `setFilters(filters); filter();` to `setFilters(filters);`
* `Tree.js`:
** Change `addFilter(filter, true);` to `addFilter(filter, false);`
** Change `removeFilter(filter);` to `removeFilter(filter, false);` and `removeFilter(filter); filter();` to `removeFilter(filter);`
* `TileGrid.js`:
** Change `addFilters(...);` to `addFilter(...);`
** Change `addFilter(filter);` to `addFilter(filter, false);` and `addFilter(filter); filter();` to `addFilter(filter);`
** Change `removeFilters(...);` to `removeFilter(...);`
** Change `removeFilter(filter);` to `removeFilter(filter, false);` and `removeFilter(filter); filter();` to `removeFilter(filter);`
** Change `setFilters(filters);` to `setFilters(filters, false);` and `setFilters(filters); filter();` to `setFilters(filters);`
* `TileAccordion.js`:
** Change `tileFilters` to `filters`
** Change `addTileFilter(filter);` to `addFilter(filter, false);` and `addTileFilter(filter); filterTiles();` to `addFilter(filter);`
** Change `removeTileFilter(filter);` to `removeFilter(filter, false);` and `removeTileFilter(filter); filterTiles();` to `removeFilter(filter);`
** Change `setTileFilters(filters);` to `setFilters(filters, false);` and `setTileFilters(filters); filterTiles();` to `setFilters(filters);`
** Change `filterTiles();` to `filter();`

These widgets support a text filter that is shown while typing if the widget is focused. This behaviour is enabled by default and can be turned off using the property `textFilterEnabled`.
Fields that provide this functionality may now be obsolete and can be removed.

== New Modules for DataModel related classes

All classes that are related to the DataModel have been moved to separate modules.
This includes `IDataModel` and the `IComposerField`. If these classes have been used you need to add the references to the new modules to the corresponding pom.xml.
The packages for these classes remain unchanged so no further migration is needed besides adding the dependencies to the new modules.
These packages are intended to be deleted in an upcoming release.

* org.eclipse.scout.rt.datamodel.client
** Everything related to the `IComposerField` can be found here
* org.eclipse.scout.rt.datamodel.server
** `FormDataStatementBuilder` and `EntityContribution` and related classes are now located here
* org.eclipse.scout.rt.datamodel.shared
** Classes related to the `IDataModel` have been moved to this module
* org.eclipse.scout.rt.datamodel.ui.html
** Json components of the `IComposerField` are located here

== Keystroke adjustments for disabled widgets (since 22.0.3)

If you created custom JavaScript keystrokes (extending from KeyStroke.js), you might experience a different behavior:
the keystroke is now only active if the widget and every parent widget is enabled.
Previously, the state of the parents was ignored, which was inconsistent.
If your keystroke should be active even if the widget is disabled, you can set `inheritAccessibility = false` on your keystroke.
