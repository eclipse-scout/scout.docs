To create new Scout components that are represented by inner classes in the Scout framework, the Scout tooling extends the Java content assist of the Eclipse Java editor.
The offered proposals are context specific.
Depending on the current cursor position in the Java editor, possible Scout components are added to the proposal list.

In a class representing a group box in a form, the Scout content assist adds proposals for various form fields are shown and in a table class the content assist adds proposals to add table columns or context menus.
Those proposals trigger the creation of inner classes for form fields, table columns or codes.
The Eclipse content assist can be started by typing kbd:[Ctrl,Space].

[[sec-sdk_new_form_field]]
==== Create new Form Fields
(((SDK Content Assist!New Form Field)))

To add additional form fields to a form the current edit position needs to be inside of a Scout group box.
Typing kbd:[Ctrl,Space] then provides access to the most frequently used Scout widgets as shown in <<img-java_proposals_groupbox>>.

When a template is selected, it is possible to customize it by navigating between the different Edit-Groups with the kbd:[Tab] Key (this works exactly like other templates in the Eclipse Editor).
With this mechanism you can quickly define the class name, the parent class and other properties.
To exit the Edit-Mode just press kbd:[Enter].

[[sec-sdk_new_table_column]]
==== Create new Table Columns
(((SDK Content Assist!New Table Column)))

For adding new columns in a table the set the current edit position inside a Scout table.
The Scout table itself may be located inside of a TableField as shown in <<img-java_proposals_table>> or can also be located inside of a Scout TablePage.

Next to adding columns the content assist shown in <<img-java_proposals_table>> can also be used to add key stroke actions and menus to tables.

==== Create new Codes
Adding new Codes to an existing CodeType is supported by the content assist as shown in <<img-java_proposals_code>>.
