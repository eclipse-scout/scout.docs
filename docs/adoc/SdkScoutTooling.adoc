Thanks to this tooling, developing Scout applications is made simpler, more productive and also more robust.
Initially, a solid understanding of the Java language is sufficient to start developing Scout applications and only a rough understanding of the underlying Maven/JEE technologies is required.

The Scout SDK also helps developers to become more productive.
Many repetitive and error prone tasks run automatically in the background or are taken care of by the component wizards of the Scout SDK.

The application code created by the Scout SDK wizards helps to ensure that the resulting Scout application has a consistent and robust code base and is well aligned with the application model defined by the Scout runtime framework.
