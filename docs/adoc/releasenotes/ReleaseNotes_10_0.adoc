* https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40eclipse-scout[All official Scout JavaScript packages]


==== IDE Tooling (Scout SDK)
In addition to the Eclipse IDE Scout 10 now officially supports https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] as well 🚀

Please find more details about the new plugin and how to install it in the corresponding section below.

===== Eclipse

You can download the complete Eclipse IDE with Scout SDK included (EPP) here: +
{scout-sdk-download-link}

To install the Scout SDK into your existing Eclipse IDE, use this update site: +
{scout-sdk-update-site}


===== IntelliJ IDEA

We are happy to announce Scout support for https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] which combines the power of IntelliJ and Scout and gives you more flexibility in choosing your favourite development environment.

However as this is the very first version of the IntelliJ plugin not all features that are available in Eclipse are available in IntelliJ yet.
We are working towards closing the gaps and bring your favourite features to IntelliJ as well.
The features supported by the latest version can bee seen in the `What's New` section of the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13393-eclipse-scout/[plugin description].
More features will come in future releases as soon as possible.

You can download the Scout plugin for IntelliJ IDEA from the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13393-eclipse-scout/[JetBrains Plugin Repository] or you can use the plugins client built into IntelliJ IDEA.
Please refer to the https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html[IntelliJ Help] on how to install and manage plugins.



=== Demo Applications
The demo applications for this version can be found on the {scout-docs-link} branch of our docs repository on GitHub.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== New Web Tool Stack

Scout updated the web tool stack from a custom implementation to a standard https://nodejs.org/[Node.js], https://webpack.js.org/[Webpack] and https://babeljs.io/[Babel] based setup.
This was required as some of the frameworks used until now (e.g. to minimize CSS and JavaScript code or to run JavaScript tests) cannot handle modern code and are no longer supported (end-of-life).

Thanks to the power of the new tool stack it is now possible to write modern JavaScript code which will be transpiled at build time so that old browsers can execute the code.
Furthermore it is easier to integrate and update 3rd party JavaScript frameworks available in the huge https://www.npmjs.com/[npm registry].

The old Scout JavaScript code has already been migrated to a modern EcmaScript 6+ code level and uses these new features.
Because of this your project specific JavaScript code must be migrated to the new level as well. Please refer to the tech doc for details about the new tool stack and to the migration guide on how to update your project.


== Widget Enhancements

=== GroupBox: New MenuBar Position TITLE

In addition to the existing menu-bar position TOP and BOTTOM, the GroupBox now supports TITLE. The menu-bar is placed in the header of the group-box right of the title-label DIV. Scout Classic: see property `menuBarPosition` in `AbstractGroupBox` and constant `IGroupBox.MENU_BAR_POSITION_TITLE`. Scout JS: see property `menuBarPosition` in `GroupBox.js` and constant `scout.GroupBox.MenuBarPosition.TITLE`.

=== TabBox: New Tab Style
The tab box has a new property `ITabBox.PROP_TAB_AREA_STYLE` with currently two possible tab styles.

* `ITabBox.TAB_AREA_STYLE_DEFAULT`: Default appearance
* `ITabBox.TAB_AREA_STYLE_SPREAD_EVEN`: This style will spread all the tabs over the available space. When using this style, all the menu will be pushed into the ellipse menu.

=== TileGrid Groups: Show Loading State per Group

Each Group in a TileGrid can now display a loading indicator in the group header individually. This is useful if each displayed
group loads data from an individual data source. Scout Classic: call `AbstractGroup#setLoading(boolean)`, Scout JS: call `Group.js#setLoading(boolean)`. Note: it is still possible to set the loading state on the TileGrid, to indicate the whole grid (and not an individual group) is loading data.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{filetype}" == "pdf"]
image::{rnimgsdir}/tile_grid_group_loading.png[]
endif::[]

=== RadioButton and CheckBox: Wrap Text

Both widgets `RadioButton` and `CheckBox` (aka BooleanField), now support the `wrapText` property. This means a radio button or a check box can have a label with a long text on multiple lines. In order to see the wrapped text, the field must have a `gridH` > 1 or set the `gridUseUiHeight` property to true.

=== Button: Support for HTML and Binary Resources

The `Button` now supports the property `htmlEnabled` which allows to use HTML in the label part of the button. You can even reference binary resources in your HTML. Simply call the method `AbstractButton#setAttachments(Collection<? extends BinaryResource>)` and define a reference, say an image URL, in your label HTML:

[source,html]
----
<img src="binaryResource:business-card.jpg" />
----

=== ImageField: Support for File Upload

The `ImageField` has a new property `uploadEnabled`. When set to true, the field opens the native file chooser and performs a file upload.

=== LabelField: Support for App Links

The `LabelField` now supports app links. In order to use app links in a label field, the property `htmlEnabled` must be set to true.

=== Mode Selector: Alternative Display Style

The mode selector now has a different appearance for the two field styles `IFormField.FIELD_STYLE_CLASSIC` and `IFormField.FIELD_STYLE_ALTERNATIVE`.

image::{rnimgsdir}/mode_selector_field_style.png[]

=== Popup: New Properties Closable, Movable, Resizable
The new properties allow a user to close, move or resize a popup using the typical controls he already knows by other widgets like a `Dialog`.
The properties are available on the `WidgetPopup` and can even be turned on or off while the popup is open.

=== Enabled & InheritAccessibility

The `enabled` property already existing for FormFields, Actions and other Scout elements has been moved to the top level Widget class.
Therefore all widgets can now be disabled as it already was in Scout JS.
Additionally Scout Classic widgets also support dynamic enabled/disabled dimensions on all widgets now as it already existed for FormFields.

The `inheritAccessibility` property that already existed for Actions (e.g. Menus) can now be used on all widgets.
This is especially interesting for FormFields for which it was necessary to do that using multiple setEnabled() calls until now.

=== Consistent Parent

Lots of Scout widgets like `Actions`, `FormFields`, `Tiles` or `Tables` can have a parent element.
Until now there have been several methods to access parent elements (e.g. `IActionNode#getParent()`, `ITile#getContainer()`, `IFormField#getParentField()`, etc.) and it was only available on the specific element (e.g. on an Action).

Now there is one `getParent()` method for all widgets. Furthermore visit methods have been added to traverse up the parent hierarchy.

=== PropertyChange Shortcut (JS)

It is now possible to listen for specific property changes rather than listening to all property change events and then checking for the right property manually.
This can be done using the new notation `propertyChange:propertyName`, see the example below.

[source,javascript]
.Listen for specific property changes
----
field.on('propertyChange:value', function(event) {
  // This listener is only executed when the 'value' property changes
  console.log('Property ' + event.propertyName + ' changed from ' + event.oldValue + ' to ' + event.newValue);
});
field.setValue('New Value.');
----
