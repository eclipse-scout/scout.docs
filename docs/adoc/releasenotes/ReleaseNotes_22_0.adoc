== UI Brush Up

The user interface has been completely reworked.
The goal was to modernize it and improve the usability without changing basic user interactions.
Modern design principles have been applied for a fresh look, an improved user guidance and increased readability.
Various widgets have been beautified like date field, smart field, table and many more.

.Brush Up
image::{rnimgsdir}/brush-up.png[]

The following topics describe some notable features of the brush-up.

=== Reworked Action Elements

Action elements like buttons, links, menus. etc. are now more user-friendly due to increased click area, clear hover effect and aligned colors.

.Menu
image::{rnimgsdir}/menu.png[]

=== Scroll Shadow

There is now a scroll shadow on every scrollable element to indicate that not all elements are visible.

.Scroll Shadow

=== Icons for Notification and Message Boxes

Notifications in GroupBoxes (`IGroupBox.setNotification()`), desktop notifications (`IDesktop.addNotification`) and message boxes now support icons.

.Notification

=== Consistent Severity Handling

There is a consistent coloring across tooltips, notifications and message boxes.

.List Box

== New 3rd Party requirements

=== Java

The Java 8 support has been dropped in Scout 22.
Scout 22 older than 22.0.3 only supports Java 11.
Scout 22.0.3 or newer supports Java 17 too. Check the migration guide for instructions on how to update to Java 17.

Furthermore, the minimal Maven version has been raised to 3.6.3.

See the migration guide for instructions on how to update.

Please note that Scout 22 makes use of `Jakarta EE 8` artifacts.
These artifacts already use the new `jakarta.\*` Maven coordinates but still contain the old `javax.*` Java packages.
This ensures backwards compatibility with older `Java EE 8` containers.
The transition to `Jakarta EE 9.1` or newer is planned for a future release.

=== Browsers

The minimal supported browsers have been updated. Scout 22 has the following requirements:

* Mozilla Firefox >= 69
* Chromium (like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave or Opera) >= 71
* Apple Safari >= 12.1

Please note that Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge Legacy are no longer supported by Scout.
If you are still using Internet Explorer or Edge Legacy, we strongly recommend updating to a newer browser.

== Native Notification Support

It's now possible to send notifications via the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API[Notification API].
The `DesktopNotification` has some new properties to control the behavior: *nativeOnly*, *nativeNotificationVisibility* and more.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Text Post-Processors

A new bean *org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.nls.ITextPostProcessor* has been introduced which allows to modify all texts returned by a TextProviderService.

This allows applying application wide logic on all translated texts including the ones provided by Scout itself.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Log4j support removed

The Support for https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/[Log4j] logging has been dropped as Log4j 1 is end-of-life.
If you still rely on Log4j 1 please consult the migration notes for instructions how to update.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Browser Field: Support for Posting Messages

Browser fields provide a new method *postMessage(data, targetOrigin)* to send arbitrary data to the embedded web page.

To prevent malicious data from being sent to your application, the origin of the message should always be validated in the callback handler
(`execPostMessage` in Java, `message` event listener in Scout JS).
Scout will now do this check automatically for you if you configure the valid origins in the new property *trustedMessageOrigins*.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== REST LookupCall support for hierarchical data

Scout lookup calls may return hierarchically linked rows (parent-child relation).
The support for hierarchical lookup rows using REST lookup calls (e.g. the `parentId` attribute definition) was moved from `AbstractLookupRowDo` to the new class `AbstractHierarchicalLookupRowDo`.

In order to support hierarchical lookups using REST, change your lookup row implementation and extend the new base class `AbstractHierachicalLookupRowDo`.

[source,java]
.Example
----
@TypeName("ExampleLookupRow")
public class ExampleLookupRowDo extends AbstractHierarchicalLookupRowDo<ExampleId> {

  @Override
  public DoValue<ExampleId> id() {
    return doValue(ID);
  }

  @Override
  public DoValue<ExampleId> parentId() {
    return doValue(PARENT_ID);
  }

  // ...
}
----

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== REST API Documentation Generation: Support for inheritance

The annotation `org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest.doc.ApiDocDescription` is now marked as `@Inherited`.
This allows inheritance for API documentation (e.g. on an abstract REST resource).

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== New Filter Field

The widgets `Table.js`, `Tree.js`, `TileGrid.js` and `TileAccordion.js` now support a text filter.
This filter field is shown while typing if the widget is focused or can be opened by clicking the icon in the bottom right corner.

.A TreeBox with the filter icon in the bottom right corner.
image::{rnimgsdir}/tree_box_with_filter_field_icon.png[]

.A TreeBox with the filter field, filtering all nodes for 'latin'.
image::{rnimgsdir}/tree_box_with_filter_field.png[]

This feature is enabled by default and can be turned off using the property `textFilterEnabled`.
For more information about the filter API and the filter field see link:{techdocjs}#filter-field[Technical Guide for Scout JS].

== Menu on Form Field

Until now, only some form fields supported menus.
In order to generalize the functionality the menu support has been moved to `IFormField.java`.
This reduces duplicated code and enables menus on every form field, e.g. on a tree field.

== Lazy Loading for Tables and Detail Forms (Scout JS)

The detail elements of a page are now loaded lazily which improves initial loading time significantly.

== Focus of Invalid Field (Scout JS)

The first invalid field now gets the focus when a form should be saved to better guide the user.
