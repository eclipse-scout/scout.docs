== About This Release

The Eclipse Scout 8.0 version is part of two simultaneous releases (https://wiki.eclipse.org/Simultaneous_Release[release schedule]):

* The initial version of Eclipse Scout 8.0 was part of the Eclipse _Photon_ release (June 27, 2018).
* An updated version was released as part of the _2018-09_ release (September 19, 2018).

The latest version of this release is: _8.0.0.021_

You can see the https://github.com/eclipse/scout.rt/compare/releases/7.0.x%2E%2E%2Ereleases/8.0.x[detailed change log] on GitHub.

=== Service Releases

Even though with Eclipse Photon there will no longer be regular Eclipse _service releases_ (see https://wiki.eclipse.org/SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Cycle_FAQ#What_is_the_Simultaneous_Release_cycle_.3F[the Simultaneous Release Cycle FAQ] for details), Scout 8.0 will continue to be maintained and a new build released from time to time. Beside bugfixes, these releases may even contain some minor features. See the following notes for details.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Java 8 required

The required Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run an Eclipse Scout application has changed: Starting with Eclipse Scout 8.0, a *Java 8 runtime is required*.

TIP: The Scout 8.0 Runtime does not support Java 9 or Java 10 yet. The support for newer Java versions is planned for a later release.

== New browser version requirements

The supported browser versions have been updated. See https://eclipsescout.github.io/8.0/technical-guide-js.html#browser-support for the new list of supported browsers.


== New SDK Feature in Eclipse: Search for missing NLS keys

If NLS keys are used in the code that do not exist in a properties file, an ugly placeholder is displayed to the user. To find such missing translations the new Menu `Scout -> Search missing text keys...` may be handy.
The result is listed in the Eclipse `Search` view.

The search also takes the scope of each NLS key into account. So that the key is considered to be available there must be a `TextProviderService` with that key on the classpath of that module.

Reported false positives can be suppressed using the following comment at the end of the corresponding line: `NO-NLS-CHECK`. Matches on that line are then not reported in future searches anymore.

== Config Properties

=== Descriptions
Config properties based on `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.IConfigProperty` include a description text. This description is stored in the new `description()` method.

The class `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.ConfigDescriptionExporter` can be used to export these descriptions. By default an AsciiDoctor exporter is included.

All Scout properties have been extended with descriptions. The same text is also part of the technical documentation.

=== Default Value
Config properties based on `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.IConfigProperty` include a default value. The default value is stored in the `getDefaultValue()` method.

The method was moved  from `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.AbstractConfigProperty<DATA_TYPE, RAW_TYPE>` to the interface. Therefore the visibility has changed from protected to public.

=== Validation
The concrete implementation `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.ConfigPropertyValidator` which validates the configuration of `config.properties` files will also check if a configured value matches the default value.
In case it does a info message (warn in development mode) will be logged but platform will still start.
To minimize configuration files such entries should be removed from `config.properties` files.

== Tree Traversal Engine Added

A tree (or graph) traversal engine has been added to the Scout Platform. The engine can traverse any tree- or graph-like structures.
See the package `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.util.visitor` especially the class `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.util.visitor.TreeTraversals` as entry point.

[source,java]
----
TreeTraversals.create(visitor, childrenSupplier).traverse(root);
----

The `root` element can be of any type. The `childrenSupplier` is a Function that returns the child elements for a given parent.
The visitor can be a `IBreadthFirstTreeVisitor` for Breadth-First visiting strategy or a `IDepthFirstTreeVisitor` for a Depth-First visiting strategy supporting pre-order and post-order traversals.

== Desktop Splitter Position Remembered Across Sessions

The position of the desktop splitter position (between the navigation and the bench) is now persisted across sessions, i.e. the previous setting will be restored even after you closed your browser. The position is stored in the HTML 5 _local storage_ provided by the local browser. It is therefore a device-specific setting, which is especially useful when accessing the same application through screens with different resolutions.

In case the splitter position should never be remembered, the feature can be disabled globally by setting the property `cacheSplitterPosition` on the desktop to _false_.

== Introducing Widget.java

On JavaScript side, there has been a class `Widget.js` for a long time now. With this release the counterpart `Widget.java` has been added. This gives all existing widgets like `FormField`, `Form`, `MessageBox`, `Action` (e.g. `Menu`), `Tree`, `Table`, `Accordion`, `Calendar`, `Desktop`, `Tile`, etc. a new common base class. It also helps creating widgets which aren't necessarily form fields.

The new Widget class handles the widget lifecycle (initConfig, init, disposed) and offers methods to visit Widget hierarchies. See `org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.ui.IWidget` for more details.

== New Widgets
=== TileGrid

The new `TileGrid` widget arranges `Tile` s in a grid by using the `LogicalGridLayout`. This is the same layout as used for a `GroupBox`, so the same `GridData` object may be used to configure how the individual tiles should be arranged.

A `Tile` directly extends `Widget` and is not much more than a `<div>` with the CSS class `tile`. The easiest way to use a tile is to use a `HtmlTile` with the displayStyle `DEFAULT`. If you need more control over the styling, you can just set the displayStyle to `PLAIN`, so that the default CSS rules are not applied, and then add your own CSS rules. If you want even more control about the layout and content you can create a custom tile instead of using the `HtmlTile`. Just create a JS class lets say `CustomTile.js` which extends from `Tile.js`, create a Java class `CustomTile.java` which extends from `AbstractTile.java` and add some glue code to link them together. See the code of the demo widgets on https://github.com/BSI-Business-Systems-Integration-AG/org.eclipse.scout.docs/tree/releases/8.0.x/code/widgets/org.eclipse.scout.widgets.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/widgets/client/ui/tiles[GitHub] for details. You could also use existing widgets as tiles. In that case instead of extending `AbstractTile` you would extend `AbstractWidgetTile` or `AbstractFormFieldTile` and set the property `tileWidget` accordingly.

In order to add the `TileGrid` to a form, you can use the class `TileField` which is basically a simple `FormField` wrapping the `TileGrid`. You cannot use the `TileGrid` directly because a `GroupBox` only accepts `FormField` s.

A demo of the widget can be found here: https://scout.bsi-software.com/widgets/?dl=widget-tilefield +
And here for the JS only version:  https://scout.bsi-software.com/jswidgets/#tilegrid

[[img-tiles]]

==== Virtual Scrolling (since Simrel 2018-12)
Similar to the virtual scrolling of the table and the tree, the tile grid now supports virtual scrolling as well. It can be enabled by setting the property `virtual` to true. Unlike for tree and table, it is not enabled by default.

Virtual Scrolling means only the tiles in the view port and some more will be rendered. The others will be rendered as soon as they will be moved into the view port, either by scrolling or by any other action like sorting, filtering etc.

This can lead to a big performance boost when having many tiles, especially on Internet Explorer, but other browsers benefit as well. To make Virtual Scrolling work, the real width and height needs to be known so that scroll bar position can be calculated correctly. This means Virtual Scrolling does only work if all tiles have the same size, so the following grid properties cannot be used: useUiWidth, useUiHeight, widthInPixel, heightInPixel, w, h, x, y.

If these preconditions are given, you can use the virtual mode and your grid will be able to handle a lot of tiles.

=== Accordion

The `Accordion` displays several collapsible `Group` s. The default behavior is to collapse every other group if one group is expanded. Because that is not in any case desired, the behavior may be disabled by setting the property `exclusiveExpand` to false.

The `Group` is a simple widget containing of a header and a body. The body may be any other widget like the new `TileGrid`. Because having tiles in an accordion is a typical use case, there is a widget called `TileAccordion` which helps creating the groups and provides some delegate methods to easily access the tiles of every group. It also takes care that selecting multiple tiles across the individual groups works as there were only one single `TileGrid`.

A demo of the accordion can be found here: https://scout.bsi-software.com/widgets/?dl=widget-accordionfield +

image::{imgsdir}/accordion.png[]

=== File Chooser Button

The new `AbstractFileChooserButton` is a value field which opens the native file chooser dialog from the browser when a user clicks on the button. The value of the field is the selected file, a `BinaryResource`. The API of the field is identical to `IFileChooserField`. The button itself does not display the selected file / value, but it is easy to do something with the value when you implement the `execChangedValue` method. For instance you could display an uploaded image in an `ImageField` on the same form.

.Example usage of file chooser button in a media file chooser
image::{imgsdir}/FileChooserButton.png[]

A demo of the file chooser button can be found here: https://scout.bsi-software.com/widgets/?widget-filechooserfield

=== Tag Field and Tag Bar

The new `AbstractTagField` is used to enter tags as used in typical "tag clouds". The value of the field is a Set of Strings, where each element is a unique tag. Like a __SmartField__ the tag field has a `LookupCall` which returns available tag names when the user starts to type something into the text field. When the user picks a tag, it appears in the tag list on the left. The field is responsive: if the tag list is too long to fit into the field, some tags go into an overflow popup. This popup is opened by clicking on the arrow-down button on the left. When the field is enabled, each tag element has a remove icon, which removes the element from the list. When the field is disabled the user cannot enter text and elements cannot be removed. It's a good idea to use the disabled tag field, if you only need to display tags.

.Tag field with open proposal chooser
image::{imgsdir}/TagField.png[]

Note: in __Scout JS__ you can also use the `scout.TagBar` widget standalone, without the tag field. This widget renders only the tag elements and deals with responsive layout.

A demo of the tag field can be found here: https://scout.bsi-software.com/widgets/?dl=widget-tagfield

== New Outline Overview

The `OutlineOverview` typically is the first thing a user sees when an outline based application starts. It is the widget displayed in the desktop bench when no page of the outline is selected. The previous `OutlineOverview` has been very simple, it basically just displayed the title and the icon of the outline. With this release a new widget has been added, it is called `TileOutlineOverview`.

As the name implies it is based on the new `TileGrid` and shows the top level pages of the current outline. The tiles itself are very simple: they show the name of the page and an icon. Because they look a lot more interesting with an icon we encourage you to set a distinct icon for each page. You can do this by using the property `overviewIconId` of a page. Note that this is not the same property as `iconId`, to be able to use different icons for the outline tree itself and the outline overview tiles.

The new outline overview is enabled by default. If you don't like the new style you can either use a `defaultDetailForm` which will be used instead of the `outlineOverview` if it is set. Or you can use the old `OutlineOverview` or even create a custom one. Compared to `defaultDetailForm`, the `outlineOverview` can only be set using JavaScript.

[[img-tile-outline-overview]]
.Tile Outline Overview
image::{imgsdir}/tile_outline_overview.png[]

== Form Fields

=== New Field Style
This release introduces a new field style called `alternative`. This is the new default style for every form field. The `classic` style is still available because it may be preferable in some circumstances, e.g. when used in a cell editor or on a form with background color like the search form. For these two cases the style is set to `classic` automatically but you can do it for your custom cases as well by setting the new property `FieldStyle`.

If you want to revert your whole application to the classic style you can create an extension to `AbstractFormField` and change the default of the `FieldStyle` property. For Scout JS applications you can set the variable `scout.FormField.DEFAULT_FIELD_STYLE` to  `scout.FormField.FieldStyle.CLASSIC`;

[[img-form-field-alternative-style]]
.New alternative field style
image::{imgsdir}/formfield_alternative.png[]

=== New Top Label Style
Along with the new alternative field style comes a new style for top labels. Since the fields don't have a top border anymore, it is not obvious that the label belongs to the field. With the new label style it is more clear and even looks better. Another advantage is that the height of the form field (incl. label) will be smaller, which is especially helpful on smaller screens.

[[img-top-label-style]]
.New top label style
image::{imgsdir}/top_label_style.png[]

=== Improved Accessibility

The label and the input are now linked by using `aria-labelledby`. This allows screen readers to read the label if an input is focused.

Furthermore, clicking the label will now activate the field. This is especially helpful on mobile devices when the new alternative style is active, because the field boundaries are not obvious anymore.

== Dynamic Fields

It is now possible to add and remove fields dynamically also when a form is already started. This feature is supported for `GroupBoxes` and `TabBoxes`.

The Java API orders the added fields considering the `order` member.

API:

* TabBox.js `insertTabItem`, `deleteTabItem`, `setTabItems`
* GroupBox.js `setFields`, `insertField`, `insertFieldBefore`, `deleteField`
* ICompositeField.java `setFields` and the already existing `addField`, `removeField` methods which don't throw an exception anymore when a form is already initialized.

[NOTE]
====
- The support for adding ProcessButtons dynamically is not implemented so far.
- Adding a field to container (`TabBox`, `GroupBox`) forces the container to be rendered. All fields in this container will be removed and rendered again.
====

== Menu and MenuBar Enhancements

=== Form Field in Menu
The menubar now supports form field menu items (`FormFieldMenu`). On the model side extend `AbstractFormFieldMenu` with a form field as an inner class to use a form field menu in any menu supporting environment.
[[img-form-field-menu]]
.Menubar with form fields
image::{imgsdir}/FormFieldMenu.png[]

=== New Property 'stackable'
The menu property `stackable` defines if a menu is stackable or not. A stackable menu will be moved to the ellipsis dropdown menu when there is not enough space in the menubar. The ellipsis menu is placed after the last stackable menu in the menubar. Right and left aligned menus will be moved to a single ellipsis menu per menubar. The horizontal alignment of the ellipsis menu is the same as the last stackable menu in the menubar.

== GroupBox Enhancements

=== Layout Configuration
It is now possible to adjust the parameters of how the group box will be layouted. The following parameters may be set:

hgap:: the horizontal gap in pixels to use between two logical grid columns
vgap:: the vertical gap in pixels to use between two logical grid rows
columnWidth:: the width in pixels to use for a grid column
rowHeight:: the height in pixels to use for a grid row
minWidth:: the minimum width of the group box. If this width is > 0 a horizontal scrollbar is shown when the group box gets smaller than this value.

These values may be set using `getConfiguredBodyLayoutConfig()`.

[[sec-gb-sublabel]]
=== Sublabel
GroupBoxes got a new property called `sublabel`. The sublabel is displayed below the title in a very small font.

=== Notification
Add a `INotification` to a group box with the new property called `notification`. +
Use `IGroupBox.setNotification(INotification)`, `getNotification()`, `removeNotification()` to control it. +
A notification has a `IStatus` which includes a severity and a message.

By default the notification is displayed at the beginning of the group box body.

A demo can be found here: https://scout.bsi-software.com/widgets/?dl=widget-groupbox +
And here for the JS only version: https://scout.bsi-software.com/jswidgets/#groupbox

== TabBox Enhancements

=== Left Aligned Menu Items
The menubar of a tabbox now considers the menu alignments _left_ and _right_. That means you can add menus directly on the right side of the last tab item (left aligned) or at the right side of the tab box header (right aligned).

[[img-tab-box-menus]]
.Menus in a tab box header
image::{imgsdir}/tabbox_menu_alignment.png[]

=== Collapsible Menu Items
Menus in the menubar will be moved to an ellipsis menu in case there is not enough space in the tabbox header. The tab items are moved to an ellipsis menu when there is not enough space for all tabs. The collapse order is as following: all menus are collapsed first before the tabs will be collapsed from right to left.
A menu can be prevented from collapsing by setting the `stackable` (`AbstractMenu.getConfiguredStackable`) property to false.

[[img-tab-box-ellipsis]]

=== Sublabel
TabItems got a `sublabel` property which is displayed in a very small font below the title (see also <<sec-gb-sublabel>>).

image::{imgsdir}/groupbox_sublabel.png[]

[[img-widget-tabitem-sublabel]]

image::{imgsdir}/tabbox_sublabel.png[]

=== Animated Selection Marker
The marker of the selected tab is now animated and follows the user or model selection.

=== Optimized Zoom Behavior
Several bugfixes of pixel issues due to zoom levels.

== Hierarchical Table Support

Scout now supports hierarchical tables. The property `parentKey` on `IColumn` is responsible for the linking between parent and child rows.
The property `hierarchicalStyle` on the table is used to switch between the default or structured style.

[[img-widget-table-hierarcical]]
.Hierarchical Table Example
image::{imgsdir}/widget_table_hierarchical.png[]

== ImageField: Support for SVG Images and Image URLs

It's now possible to use SVG images in the same way as bitmap images. Simply put the .svg file in the `/icons` folder of the client module and reference the SVG image in any widget that supports the `iconId` property. Example:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected String getConfiguredIconId() {
  return "person.svg";
}
----

Additionally you can now reference an image by URL, for instance an image hosted on an external server. Use the property ´imageUrl` of the AbstractImageField to reference the image. Note: the AbstractImageField defines a priority for which one of the three image properties is used to render the image in the browser:

1. _image_ (Binary resource)
2. _imageUrl_
3. _imageId_

== CheckBoxField: Add Support for Key Strokes

The check box field (`IBooleanField`) got a new property called `keyStroke`. The property expects a string defining the key stroke, e.g. `ctrl-b`. When the key stroke is executed the check box value will be toggled. Other widgets like `Button`, `RadioButton` or `Menu` already support that feature in the same way.

== RadioButtonGroup Enhancements

=== Layout Customizations

A new property `gridColumnCount` has been added to the radio button group. It can be used using `setGridColumnCount()`, `getGridColumnCount()` and `getConfiguredGridColumnCount()`. By default the columns are configured to be dependent on the height of the field to create columns as needed to show all radio buttons within the height available (this also corresponds to the existing behavior).

But it also allows to specify an exact number over how many columns radio buttons should be distributed. This is an alternative to layout the buttons using the group height and is especially useful if the number of radio buttons is unknown or dynamic. In that case the columns can be configured to e.g. 3 and the property `useUiHeight` to true allowing the group to vertically grow as needed to show all radio buttons within 3 columns. This property also corresponds to the layout possibilities of the group box.

The same possibilities also exist in the JavaScript only layer of Scout using the method `setGridColumnCount()`.

=== Grid Calculation (JS)
The logical grid is now calculated automatically as it is done for a `GroupBox` or for a `RadioButtonGroup` in Java. This means you can only specify the width (`w`) and height (`h`) of a cell using `gridDataHints`, the position (`x`, `y`) will be calculated automatically.

=== Value Support (JS)
The `RadioButtonGroup` now supports the value operations provided by `ValueField`, similar to the Java implementation. This means you can define a `radioValue` on each `RadioButton` and then use `setValue()` to select a button using its radioValue. When reading the `value` of a `RadioButtonGroup`, the `radioValue` of the selected button is returned.

=== Lookup Call Support (JS)
In addition to specify the radio buttons explicitly, a lookup call can now be used. When defining a lookup call the radio buttons are created based on the result of that lookup call.

== SequenceBox: Grid Calculation (JS)
The logical grid is now calculated automatically as it is done for a `GroupBox` or for a `SequenceBox` in Java. This means you can only specify the width (`w`) and height (`h`) of a cell using `gridDataHints`, the position (`x`, `y`) will be calculated automatically.

== ListBox Enhancements
=== Default table creation (JS)
The Scout `ListBox` is based on the Scout `Table`. Such a list box table typically is checkable, only has one column and doesn't have a header. Since this is true for most list boxes it is not necessary anymore to specify the table explicitly. A default table will be created if none is provided.

=== Lookup Call Support (JS)
In order to fill the list box a `LookupCall` can now be used. The resulting lookup rows will be mapped to actual table rows and inserted into the list box table.

=== Value Support (JS)
The `ListBox` now supports the value operations provided by `ValueField`, similar to the Java implementation. The value represents the keys of the checked rows specified by the corresponding lookup rows.

== FileChooser(Field) Enhancements (JS)
`FileChooser` can now be used without a running Java UI server.
`FileChooserField` now supports the value operation provided by 'ValueField'. The value of this widgets is the `File` object. Display text is the filename. Accepted types and maximum upload size are supported properties.

== Smartfield Enhancements

=== New Property 'searchRequired'
A new property `searchRequired` has been introduced for Smartfields.
It is similar to the one already existing in `org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.ui.desktop.outline.pages.AbstractPageWithTable` and controls the Smartfield behavior if the proposal-list is opened without having a search constraint.
By default (_searchRequired_ = `false`) all existing proposals are shown if no search constraint has been typed. But if the property is set to `true`, the Smartfield only shows proposals if a search constraint is available.
This is especially useful if a large data set is expected in a Smartfield lookup which usually makes no sense to present all to the user.
In that case a message is shown instead informing that a search constraint is required to load data and to see proposals.

In Java the property can be set using `ISmartField.setSearchRequired()` or `AbstractSmartField.getConfiguredSearchRequired()`.
In JavaScript the property can be set using `smartfield.setSearchRequired()`.

=== New Event 'prepareLookupCall' on Smartfields (JS)
In Scout JS a new event `prepareLookupCall` has been added to the SmartField. It allows to be notified when the field is about to execute a LookupCall.
Because for each call a fresh LookupCall clone is executed this event allows to propagate properties to the executing LookupCall clone. These properties may then be used when the call is executed (e.g. sent to the backend).

=== Support for Horizontal Alignment (since 8.0.0.021)
The horizontal alignment can already be controlled for number and string fields using the `horizontalAlignment` property of the `gridData`. The property already existed for `SmartFields` but it had no effect, until now.

== NumberField: support for minimum and maximum values (JS)

The Scout JS NumberField now also supports min- and max-values as it was already present in Scout Classic.

== Improved useUiHeight Calculation

If a form field is set to use its ui height, it is supposed to be as big as its content. A typical example is the group box: `useUiHeight` is true by default to make the group box as height as the containing form fields. In that case it works fine because the height does not depend on the width.

There are cases where the height depends on the width, e.g. if a label field is set to wrap its text (property `wrapText` = true). These cases did not work correctly because in order to calculate the preferred height the final width has to be known. This has been fixed so that setting `useUiHeight` to true should now work as expected.

== Enhanced IUiServletRequestHandler

UI Servlet request handler now supports all HTTP methods and not only GET and POST.
When using `AbstractUiServletRequestHandler` no migration should be required, see migration guide for further information.

== Automatic Preloading of Web Fonts

To prevent incorrect measurements or the so-called "FOUT effect" (Flash Of Unstyled Text), Scout tries to preload all necessary web font files (*.woff) before rendering the application. To make it easier for projects to add theme-dependent fonts, the font preloader has been improved. The list of fonts to preload is now detected automatically by inspecting the document's style sheet (_@font-face_ rules). It's no longer necessary to manually list all fonts in the bootstrap argument of `scout.App` (see migration guide).

== Refactored EventListenerList

The class _EventListenerList_ had poor performance with large numbers of listeners and add / remove operations.
There are two new alternatives to this class that are also thread-safe and support higher performance:

* `FastListenerList<LISTENER>` is used to manage a single type of listeners.
* `AbstractGroupedListenerList` is used as base class to handle a single type of listener with multiple type partitions. See the new classes TreeListeners and TableListeners for an example of applicability.

[NOTE]
====
Consider refactoring the use of _EventListenerList_ by one of the new alternatives.
====

== Text and Multi-Language Support Moved to 'platform'

Scout's multi-language text support mainly consists of `ITextProviderService` (with the default abstract implementation `AbstractDynamicNlsTextProviderService`) and the convenience accessor `TEXTS`.

This facility was moved from the module `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared` to `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform`. This allows the use of multi-language text support without the need to include _*.shared_ dependencies in your project. This is especially useful for server-only applications (e.g. micro services).

_Migration:_ Change the ``import``s in your _*.java_ files accordingly.

== Data Object Support for REST & MOM APIs

The Scout platform was extended by a generic data object support.
Data objects are Scout beans, which can be used as data transfer objects for synchroneous REST and asynchroneous MOM interfaces.
Furthermore they may be used as domain objects within business logic.

Using the new `DoEntity` class as base class, any kind of custom data objects can be built.
An attributes of a data object is defined by adding an accessor method for the attribute.
The name of the method corresponds to the attribute name; the attribute type is defined by the return value of the method.

[source,java]
.Example data object definition
----
@TypeName("ExampleEntity")
public class ExampleEntityDo extends DoEntity {

  public DoValue<String> name() { // <1>
    return doValue("name");
  }

  public DoList<Integer> values() { // <2>
    return doList("values");
  }
}
----

The Scout platform defines the `IDataObjectMapper` interface which offers method to serialize and deserialize data objects from and to a string representation.
The default implementation of `IDataObjectMapper` is based on the popular https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] serializing data objects to a JSON document.
The implementation can be exchanged by a custom implementation based on another library.

== REST Resources & REST Clients

The new Scout module `org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest` adds basic support for REST resources and REST resource clients within the Scout framework.
Available REST resources are automatically found by Jandex class inventory and registered at runtime.

== Deprecated methods on DefaultAuthToken and introduced DefaultAuthTokenSigner and DefaultAuthTokenVerifier (since 8.0.0.021)
In order to be able to reuse authentication token code `DefaultAuthToken` was refactored.
Signing and verifying of tokens is now separated from token and its (de-)serialization.
The new classes DefaultAuthTokenSigner and DefaultAuthTokenVerifier do now provide this functionality.
