== About This Release

The latest version of this release is: {maven-version}.

You can see the {github-changelog-link} on GitHub.

Coming from an older Scout version? Check out the {migration-guide-link} for instructions on how to obtain the new version and upgrade existing applications.

//
//WARNING: {NotReleasedWarning}
//
//(Section intentionally left blank for possible future release)
//
// * <<New Feature (since 23.1.0.xyz)>>
//
// ==== Upcoming -- No Planned Release Date
//
// The following changes were made after the latest official release build. No release date has been fixed yet.
//
// WARNING: {NotReleasedWarning}

== Demo Applications

The demo applications for this version can be found on the {scout-docs-link} branch of our docs repository on GitHub.

If you just want to play around with them without looking at the source code, you can always use the deployed versions:

== ObjectType as Class Reference (Scout JS)
It is now possible to use a class reference as `objectType`.
An `objectType` is typically used when creating a new object using `scout.create(objectType)` or when defining a model.
Using a class reference instead of a string will make the development easier because the IDE knows about the actual type and can provide
code completion or and other assistance.

It may even improve the tree shaking process of the bundler (webpack).
Because using a class reference requires an `import`, the bundler automatically includes the imported module.

So,
[source, js]
----
scout.create('Button', {parent: this});
----

becomes this:

[source, js]
----
import {Button} from '@eclipse-scout/core';

scout.create(Button, {parent: this});
----

And this
[source, js]
----
export default () => ({
  objectType: 'Form',
  rootGroupBox: {
    objectType: 'GroupBox'
  }
});
----

becomes this:

[source,js]
----
import {Form, GroupBox} from '@eclipse-scout/core';

export default () => ({
  objectType: Form,
  rootGroupBox: {
    objectType: GroupBox
  }
});
----

Please see the {migration-guide-link} for migration assistance.

== Typed NodeId for node identifier

In previous versions several ways were used to create/use a node identfier (e.g. to identify a specific client/backend server):

* A typed class NodeId existed, the current identifier was accessed using `org.eclipse.scout.rt.dataobject.id.NodeId.current()`
* Node identifiers could be accessed as String using `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.context.NodeIdentifier.get()`
* And another node identifier (default implementation random UUID) could be accessed using  `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.INode#ID`

As of version 23.1 the typed `org.eclipse.scout.rt.dataobject.id.NodeId` is used wherever possible, the application scoped bean `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.context.NodeIdentifier` is still used for the computation of this typed `NodeId`. The `get()` method returning a `String` has been deprecated, the interface `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.INode` has been removed.

== IId interface, new IRootId and ICompositeId

In previous versions the `IId` interface was typed with a generic `WRAPPED_TYPE extends Comparable<WRAPPED_TYPE>`.
To be able to use the `IId` interface as general root for any kind of identifiers without having to deal with a concrete generic type, the generic type definition was removed and moved to the default implementation `AbstractRootId` and the typed sub-interfaces `IUuid`, `IStringId` and `ILongId`.

As new feature IIds may consist of multiple wrapped components (e.g. composite ids). Use `ICompositeId` and `AbstractCompositeId` as base to build own composite types.
Based on the adapted serialization mechanism (see `IdFactory` and IdCodec` classes) composite ids may also be used in data objects and REST APIs like the existing root ids.

[source,java]
.Example composite id based on an example string id and an example uuid
----
@IdTypeName("example.ExampleCompositeId")
public final class ExampleCompositeId extends AbstractCompositeId {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  private ExampleCompositeId(ExampleStringId c1, ExampleUuId c2) {
    super(c1, c2);
  }

  @RawTypes
  public static ExampleCompositeId of(String c1, UUID c2) {
    if (StringUtility.isNullOrEmpty(c1) || c2 == null) {
      return null;
    }
    return new ExampleCompositeId(ExampleStringId.of(c1), ExampleUuId.of(c2));
  }

  public static ExampleCompositeId of(ExampleStringId c1, ExampleUuId c2) {
    if (c1 == null || c2 == null) {
      return null;
    }
    return new ExampleCompositeId(c1, c2);
  }
}
----

== Calendar Widget

The calendar component item of the calendar widget has new attributes:

* subjectIconId - icon is showed in the calendar component in front of the subject
* subjectLabel - label in tooltip on top of the subject
* subjectAppLink - appLink in tooltip of calendar component
* descriptionElements - list of `ICalendarItemDescriptionElement` which is displayed in the body of the tooltip of the calendar component
