== Improved Developer Experience for Scout JS

Scout 23.1 contains many improvements for Scout JS developers.
The goal was to make the development easier, more efficient and more fun.
Please read the following chapters to learn how we did it.

=== TypeScript Support

One major addition in this release is TypeScript support.

* We migrated the complete Scout JS code base to TypeScript. This means the Scout API is now fully typed.
* We enhanced the JS build, so you can write TypeScript yourself in your project.

This gives you many benefits:

* *More efficient development* +
Typing allows your IDE to better assist with code completion during development and to only suggest methods and properties for an object that actually exist. +
+
.Better Code Completion
image::{rnimgsdir}/code_completion.png[]
* *Easier entry* +
With better code completion and clear method signatures, a not-so-experienced JavaScript developer can more easily get up to speed and understand the relationships in the code.
* *More confidence when updating* +
If a used API has changed, the code turns red and the build fails.
* *More confidence during development* +
Incorrect use of an API or code in general is detected at an early stage. The developer gets more confidence that his code will work. +
+
.Compile Errors

=== Well-Defined and Typed Widget Models

Widgets can be configured in many ways using the available properties.
Until now, it was not obvious which properties were available and what they do.
To improve that, every widget now comes with a well-defined model which contains all available properties including a description.
The model is a TypeScript interface and named after the widget with the suffix `Model`.
For example, you will find the model of a `Menu` under the name `MenuModel`.

.Widget Model
image::{rnimgsdir}/widget_model.png[]

The models can not only be used for documentation purposes, TypeScript and Scout SDK use them as well for code completion and type checks.

=== Well-Defined and Typed Widget Events

Most of the widgets can trigger events that can be used to react to user interactions.
Until now, it was not obvious which events were available.
To improve that, every widget now comes with a well-defined event map which contains all available events.
The event map is a TypeScript interface and named after the widget with the suffix `EventMap`.
For example, you will find the event map of a `Menu` under the name `MenuEventMap`.

These event maps are used by TypeScript to provide code completion for the event name when adding an event handler:

.Event Name Completion
image::{rnimgsdir}/event_completion.png[]

You also get the correct type of the event itself including its members in the handler:

.Typed Event
image::{rnimgsdir}/typed_events.png[]

=== Typed Return Values When Finding Widgets

Retrieving a widget is typically done by using `this.widget('id')`.
The result of that function is a generic `Widget`, so it is not possible to call a method of a specific widget without casting (at least with TypeScript).
To do the type casting, you can either specify the return type directly at the time of usage.

.Using the second parameter
[source,js]
----
import {Menu} from '@eclipse-scout/core';

let menu = this.widget('YourId', Menu);
----

.Cast manually (TypeScript)
[source,ts]
----
import {Menu} from '@eclipse-scout/core';

let menu = this.widget('YourId') as Menu;
----

Or you can use widget maps.
A widget map is an interface that maps the ids of the widgets to their type.
This allows TypeScript to determine the return type automatically.

.Event Name Completion
image::{rnimgsdir}/typed_widget.png[]

Scout SDK takes care of creating the widget maps, so you don't have to write them manually.

=== ObjectType as Class Reference

It is now possible to use a class reference as `objectType`.
An `objectType` is typically used when creating a new object using `scout.create(objectType)` or when defining a model.
Using a class reference instead of a string will make the development easier because the IDE knows about the actual type and can provide
code completion and other assistance.

It may even improve the tree shaking process of the bundler (webpack).
Because using a class reference requires an `import`, the bundler automatically includes the imported module.

So,
[source,js]
----
scout.create('Button', {parent: this});
----

becomes this:

[source,js]
----
import {Button} from '@eclipse-scout/core';

scout.create(Button, {parent: this});
----

And this
[source, js]
----
export default () => ({
  objectType: 'Form',
  rootGroupBox: {
    objectType: 'GroupBox'
  }
});
----

becomes this:

[source,js]
----
import {Form, GroupBox} from '@eclipse-scout/core';

export default () => ({
  objectType: Form,
  rootGroupBox: {
    objectType: GroupBox
  }
});
----

Please see the {migration-guide}#ObjectType%20as%20Class%20Reference%20(Scout%20JS)[Migration Guide] for migration assistance.

=== MenuTypes

==== Constants

Constants have been added for all menu types of

* Calendar
* ImageField
* Planner
* TabBox
* Table
* Tree
* ValueField

Instead of using string literals in e.g. a `MenuModel` one can use these constants now. Therefore, this

[source,ts]
----
import {Menu} from '@eclipse-scout/core';

{
  id: 'ExampleMenu',
  text: 'Example',
  objectType: Menu,
  menuTypes: [
    'Table.SingleSelection'
  ]
}
----

becomes this:

[source,ts]
----
import {Menu, Table} from '@eclipse-scout/core';

{
  id: 'ExampleMenu',
  text: 'Example',
  objectType: Menu,
  menuTypes: [
    Table.MenuTypes.SingleSelection
  ]
}
----

==== Menu type support for ValueField and ImageField

Menu type support has been added to the `ValueField` and the `ImageField`.
This means that e.g. the `ValueField` will display different menus whether a value is set or not.
For more information about the menuType support of `ValueField` and `ImageField` see link:{techdocjs}#menu-types[Technical Guide for Scout JS].

== JavaScript Code Migration Tool

It is normal that code changes from time to time even on a larger scale.
Since code migration is often a tedious task, any automation is welcome.

With this release there are several code migration tasks, which are mostly optional, but recommended.
That is why we tried to automate as much as possible and created a tool you can use as well.

The main purpose of the tool is to migrate your JavaScript code to TypeScript, but other migration tasks make use of the tool as well.
Instructions for these tasks can be found in the {migration-guide-link}.

If you would like to migrate your existing code to TypeScript, the migration tool will certainly help you.
But be aware, that the majority of the work, which is adding types, will need to be done manually.

Migrating to TypeScript is not required, you can still use JavaScript or write only new code with TypeScript.
However, if you are a library developer, we recommend migrating to TypeScript to make the usage of the library easier.

Detailed instruction for the migration can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-scout/migrate[@eclipse-scout/migrate]

If you plan to use TypeScript for new code without migrating your existing code base, you just need to add a `tsconfig.json` like described here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-scout/tsconfig[@eclipse-scout/tsconfig]

== JavaScript Build Improvements

=== Library Build

If code is written with TypeScript, it needs to be transpiled to JavaScript before it can be used.
Because this task takes some time, it should not be done by the project using a TypeScript library but by the library itself.
This is true for Scout as well. Therefore, Scout 23.1 is shipped with prebuilt JavaScript code.

To make sure your build uses the prebuilt version, your import statements need to be correct.
Please have a look at the migration guide for details: {migration-guide}#Imports[Migration Guide].

If you are a library developer, you should consider doing the same.
To do so, you can use the support provided by Scout's build tooling as described here: {techdocjs}#Authoring%20Libraries[Authoring Libraries].

=== Faster and more Efficient Minification

The Scout build now uses https://esbuild.github.io/[ESBuild] for the minification process.
This reduces the duration and memory consumption of the production build a lot, which is especially beneficial if your build runs in a cloud environment with limited hardware.

=== TypeScript Build

As already mentioned in <<TypeScript Support>>, you can now use TypeScript for your Scout JS project or when writing custom widgets for Scout Classic.

All you have to do is to create a `tsconfig.json` that extends from the default configuration provided by Scout as explained here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-scout/tsconfig[@eclipse-scout/tsconfig]
The Scout build will transpile all files ending with `*.ts` and will start a separate process to check if the types are correct.
That way you will not be blocked by the type checking, but you will still be informed if some types are wrong.

=== ESLint for TypeScript

We added linting support for TypeScript files.

If you are already using Scout's eslint module (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-scout/eslint[@eclipse-scout/eslint]), you'll get the linting automatically.

== Typed NodeId for Node Identifier

In previous versions several ways were used to create/use a node identfier (e.g. to identify a specific client/backend server):

* A typed class NodeId existed, the current identifier was accessed using `org.eclipse.scout.rt.dataobject.id.NodeId.current()`
* Node identifiers could be accessed as String using `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.context.NodeIdentifier.get()`
* And another node identifier (default implementation random UUID) could be accessed using  `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.INode#ID`

As of version 23.1 the typed `org.eclipse.scout.rt.dataobject.id.NodeId` is used wherever possible, the application scoped bean `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.context.NodeIdentifier` is still used for the computation of this typed `NodeId`. The `get()` method returning a `String` has been deprecated, the interface `org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.INode` has been removed.

== IId Interface, new IRootId and ICompositeId

In previous versions the `IId` interface was typed with a generic `WRAPPED_TYPE extends Comparable<WRAPPED_TYPE>`.
To be able to use the `IId` interface as general root for any kind of identifiers without having to deal with a concrete generic type, the generic type definition was removed and moved to the default implementation `AbstractRootId` and the typed sub-interfaces `IUuid`, `IStringId` and `ILongId`.

As new feature IIds may consist of multiple wrapped components (e.g. composite ids). Use `ICompositeId` and `AbstractCompositeId` as base to build own composite types.
Based on the adapted serialization mechanism (see `IdFactory` and IdCodec` classes) composite ids may also be used in data objects and REST APIs like the existing root ids.

[source,java]
.Example composite id based on an example string id and an example uuid
----
@IdTypeName("example.ExampleCompositeId")
public final class ExampleCompositeId extends AbstractCompositeId {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

  private ExampleCompositeId(ExampleStringId c1, ExampleUuId c2) {
    super(c1, c2);
  }

  @RawTypes
  public static ExampleCompositeId of(String c1, UUID c2) {
    if (StringUtility.isNullOrEmpty(c1) || c2 == null) {
      return null;
    }
    return new ExampleCompositeId(ExampleStringId.of(c1), ExampleUuId.of(c2));
  }

  public static ExampleCompositeId of(ExampleStringId c1, ExampleUuId c2) {
    if (c1 == null || c2 == null) {
      return null;
    }
    return new ExampleCompositeId(c1, c2);
  }
}
----

== New Calendar Tooltip

The calendar component item of the calendar widget has new attributes:

* subjectIconId - icon is showed in the calendar component in front of the subject
* subjectLabel - label in tooltip on top of the subject
* subjectAppLink - appLink in tooltip of calendar component
* descriptionElements - list of `ICalendarItemDescriptionElement` which is displayed in the body of the tooltip of the calendar component

.Calendar Component
image::{rnimgsdir}/calendar_tooltip.png[]

Further the calendar provides now a time range selection in the day, work week and week mode. By default, this feature is disabled, it can be configured with the `rangeSelectionAllowed` property. The start point and end point of the current selected time range can be accessed with the `selectedRange` property.

== Categories for Health Checkers

For the health check servlet `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.AbstractHealthCheckServlet` a new query parameter _category_ has been introduced to create the possibility to check only some specific health checkers for a specific category. If a category is supplied using the parameter, the actual `IHealthChecker` checkers are filtered using the method `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.IHealthChecker.acceptCategory(HealthCheckCategoryId)`.

If no category is provided there is no change in behavior and all checkers are executed.
If an invalid category is provided an error is logged and the same behavior is executed as no category was provided.

=== API Changes

* New method `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.IHealthChecker.acceptCategory(HealthCheckCategoryId)` was added, default implementation always returns `true`
* Parameter `HealthCheckCategoryId` was added for `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.IHealthChecker.checkHealth(RunContext, HealthCheckCategoryId)`; if health check itself does not rely on a specific category ignore this parameter
* Parameter `HealthCheckCategoryId` was added for `org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.commons.healthcheck.AbstractHealthChecker.execCheckHealth(HealthCheckCategoryId)`; if health check itself does not rely on a specific category ignore this parameter

== JsForm

The JsForm is a Java-form that wraps a form implemented in JS. This allows a Scout Classic application to open a Scout JS form.
For more information about the JsForm see link:{techdoc}#how-to-js-form[Technical Guide].
