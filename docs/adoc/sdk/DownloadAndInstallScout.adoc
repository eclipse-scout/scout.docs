==== Prerequisites

Before you can install the Scout SDK make sure that you have a working Java Development Kit (JDK) installation version 11.

You can check your installation on the command line as follows.

----
console-prompt>java -version
openjdk version "11.0.11" 2021-04-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK-11.0.11+9 (build 11.0.11+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK-11.0.11+9 (build 11.0.11+9, mixed mode)
----

Please note that the Scout does not officially support other Java versions, but it may still work.

When downloading a Java 11 JDK it is recommended to choose version 11.0.11 or newer.
Please note that only x64 hardware architectures are supported.

You can download the JDK matching your operating system from the https://adoptium.net/[Adoptium homepage].
Afterwards extract the archive to a location of your choice.

==== Install the Scout Package

To download the Eclipse Scout package visit the official Eclipse download page.

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages[www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages]

The download page lists all available Eclipse packages. Scroll to the package "Eclipse IDE for Scout Developers" and select the download for your preferred platform.

After the package selection, confirm the suggested download mirror as shown in <<img-scout_download_mirror>>.

As the Scout package is a simple ZIP (or tar.gz) file, you may unpack its content to a folder of your choice.
Inside the eclipse sub-folder, you will then find the Eclipse executable file, such as the `eclipse.exe` file on a Windows plattform.
Starting the Eclipse executable brings up the workspace launcher as shown in <<img-scout_start>>.

Into the [field]_Workspace_ field you enter an empty target directory for your first Scout project.
After clicking the btn:[Ok] button, the Eclipse IDE creates any directories that do not yet exist and opens the specified workspace.
When opening a new workspace for the first time, Eclipse then displays the welcome screen shown in <<img-scout_welcome>>.

To close the welcome page and open the Scout perspective in the Eclipse IDE click on the [icon]_Workbench_ icon.
As a result the empty Java perspective is displayed according to <<img-scout_perspective>>.
